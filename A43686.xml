            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When I heard how barbarouſly, and inhumanely you were uſed; that you who are Proteſtants ſhould ſuffer more by thoſe that pretend to be of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion than Papiſts do, or then in ſome places, Protestants do by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (who rarelly are defective in Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty) it prevailed with me to write

            <p>Though many have writ well, and ſubſtantially of ſufferings in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; yet I know none that have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Particular Subject (except in ſome Collateral way) which now I do. For had it been already done, I ſhould not have engaged therein; judging my ſelf unable to add (by way of ſupplement, or amendment) to the work of any other.</p>
            <p>I wiſh this work had come into the world more fil'd and poliſhed, and that it were ſo elaborate that none might diſlike it. But as when a man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hungry, and thirſty, courſe Bread, and impure Liquors are better then none; ſo this <hi>Conjuncture,</hi> when ſo many are expoſed to ſuch cruel ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, and ſuch great havock made of
<pb facs="tcp:108256:4"/> their Goods (that it may be difficult without ſuccumbency, and ſinking to ſtand under the burden; or with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, and compoſed temper of mind to bear the ſame) a few truths (though crudely, and indigeſtedly delivered) concerning the most <hi>Excellent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> in another world may be better than none, both for their Conſolation, and Suſtentation</p>
            <p>What I have done, had in a very little time both its Conception &amp; Birth, which makes it more without <hi>Form;</hi> and it may be, expoſe me to ſevere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for too much raſhneſs, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſs. But being Alarum'd by ſo many Cryes of Wrong, Injuſtice, and Cruelty (ſuch as most Heathens would abhor) that you labor and groan under, I was reſolved to incur the danger thereof, rather than take much time for its <hi>Cultivation,</hi> or to ſend it better accompliſhed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coultred into the world; leaſt while
<pb facs="tcp:108256:4"/> the Cordial was too long a preparing, too many Spirits might languiſh and faint.</p>
            <p>What Common Equity (ſuch as univerſal humane Reaſon conſents to) is in the Late Act against Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and how agreeable it is to the Fundamental Laws of our Nation, and the Laws of the Supreme <hi>Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator</hi> (God himſelf) ſhall one day be known, when all Diſputes, and Controverſies concerning the ſame ſhall be concluded, and have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Period put thereunto. But you ſuffer not according to the ſtrictest ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of that Law only, but far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, and indeed in a way very often moſt <hi>Contra-legal,</hi> and excentrick to all Law; many Instances whereof might be collected together, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to publick view, to let the World know, how much his Majesties peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Subjects, only for worſhipping God according to his Word, are made a

            <p>This is the Aggravation of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and makes the burden there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more ponderous and heavy, that when you become Complainants you can have no redreſs, or relief. If you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the General Seſſions, there your Judges (as the major part) are both Enemies, and parties concerned; and what Juries ar a, woful experience tells you.

            <p>Though the immediate, and direct intention of this Treatiſe is for thoſe that are, or may be impoveriſhed for Religions ſake, yet it may be of uſe likewiſe to all Gods Children, who by ſome croſs afflicting Providences (and not by their wickedneſs) are reduced to a low condition in the World.

            <pb facs="tcp:108256:9"/>
            <p>I know there are many Miniſters in theſe Nations who have ſuffered the loſs of their Goods (not for a ſullen peeviſh humor as many are pleaſed to charg them ſeverely with, and calumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them for) but for Conſcience ſake; &amp; I acknowledg theſe men much more Worthy and Learned than my ſelf, and that their Parts and Abilities would have fabriated a much more curious and amiable Piece (for the honor of that Cauſe for which they ſuffer) than this is, and I heartily wiſh ſome one of them had ſeaſonably done, that ſo it might have come abroad into the world in a better dreſs, with fewer defects, &amp; imperfections, leſs crude &amp; immature, and ſo might have been food ſuited to the most Critical, Curious and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Palates.

            <p>I know ſome may ſcornfully, and ſcoffingly ſay, what need is there for theſe Nonconformists to read ſuch a Subject for their encouragement; What have they lost? do they not live better, and more plentifully than ever they did? This is uſual and frequent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage diffus'd through <hi>England,</hi> and other places: to which it may briefly be replyed, there is no thanks due to thoſe that aſſert it for the ſame. Have not they, and their party taken the most effectual courſe, and means they could to ſtarve, and famiſh thoſe above mentioned? They ſhewed them not ſo much mercy as was ſhewed to
<pb facs="tcp:108256:11"/> them in the late times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation: For they tear away all from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them not the fifths of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, (as then was, whether ſmall or great) not ſuffering them to teach School, to get bread for their Wives &amp; Children; not to live in, or come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five miles of a Corporation, or place where they had preached, to cut them off from all relief; not to Preach pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to their Friends (by one Law if they were above five, by another if above four, &amp; above the Age of <hi>16.</hi> the Iron Yoke whereof many have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently felt) a Cruelty they felt not under the Government of thoſe, it's acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged were Tyrants &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers: For ſeveral of them had their Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (ſome whereof conſiſted of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Numbers, witneſs the <hi>Canary Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> privately and peaceably. It's Notoriouſly known that thoſe very men who in thoſe times were ejected for moſt Enormous Scandals,
<pb facs="tcp:108256:11"/> as Drunkenneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sabbath-breaking, and for Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance a large Catalogue whereof can be yet produced) had more mercy &amp; favor ſhewed them, than theſe men that cannot be proved guilty of any ſuch things, nor were they the Crimes layed to their charge, for which they were laid aſide. It's known, and can be proved that ſeveral of the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Epiſcopal Ministers, or if you will (as they term themſelves) Priests, though they were cast out of one Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they were put into the poſſeſſion of another, &amp; that ſomtimes of equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and if not ſo, yet what did afford them a preſent Livelihood, &amp; Subſtance. It can never be proved (tho it's fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſerted) that this mercileſs and bowelleſs uſage is <hi>Lex talionis,</hi> the Law of Retaliation, for ſuch Laws were never made againſt them, as have been (by their procurement, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they greatly rejoyce) againſt theſe.
<pb facs="tcp:108256:12"/> And if there were any ſuch Laws then, they were either good or evil; if they were good, why do they condemn them; if they were evil, why do they imitate them?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that ſuch Prieſts, and ſome that were accounted Fathers of the Church, begg'd in thoſe times their bread, had ſcarce cloaths to cover their Nakedneſs, &amp; ſhelter them from the Storms and Cold, travel'd up &amp; down a foot, and had ſcarce beds to lie upon, and that ſome of them dyed for want; whereas the Nonconformists are full fed, their Cheeks are plump (though few, or none of their Noſes be very red and fiery, their Faces (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what's occaſioned by natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and diſtempers) of a deep Scarlet dye, or look most formidablly as if they were waſh'd and ſteept in the Sanguine juice, or blood of the Grape) their Aſpects and looks brisk and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they wear good Cloaths, and ride
<pb facs="tcp:108256:12"/> good Horſes To this it may be reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that one Reaſon why many of them were reduced to ſuch ſcarcity &amp; want, was their intemperance, their exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive drinking, being ſworn Slaves to Pots of good Ale, and Bottles of Wine and indeed moſt of what they got was Sacrificed ſometimes to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>Venus</hi> (which two will devour and drink up an Ocean of Treaſure, and conſume vast Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Gold and Silver) but thoſe that were not guilty of ſuch beſtial lives and converſations, but were men of great Sobriety and Civility, and yet ſuffered ſuch want; it ſhews that God did not take that care of them that now he doth of others, and that there is not ſo much Religion (which makes mens bowels tender, and their Charity diffuſive and extenſive) to be found among the Sons and Daughters of the Church, as among thoſe that are diſſenters from her, and too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:108256:13"/> (though injuriouſly) branded with Schiſm.</p>
            <p>But however plentifully now they live, was this by an eye of ſence, and reaſon foreſeen when they voluntarily left their livelyhoods and Benefices rather than make Naufrage, &amp; Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Faith and a good Conſcience. Certainly they did not then conſult with fleſh and blood, or act like men whoſe Souls are under the Dominion of their Senſes, for theſe would ſtrenuouſly argue, and plead againſt their pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, againſt their Nonconformity, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them the many difficulties and ſtraits and hardſhips they muſt expoſe themſelves to paſs thorow, and make their lives miſerable and wretched with. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſanctified Reaſon (which always oppoſeth the Interest of God in the world when abſtracted from a mans own) would never plead for this, or paſs an Approbative judgment upon it. Such Queſtions would be put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,

And that ſuch carnal reaſonings muſt in all probability be in moſt Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, appears from the Confeſſions of ſeveral that this was the ground of their Conformity.

In purſuance of his end, he employed ſeveral to ſearch it out. One of them when he was upon the ſcent, not being able to underſtand where the Game did lie, comes to a Miniſter (whoſe learning and parts are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known in the Country where he
<pb facs="tcp:108256:18"/> lives) to be informed of this thing, declaring to him that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo to do by the Biſhop? To whom the Minister replies, come, and I will ſhew thee how I live: Look into this Pot and ſee a piece of good Beef boyling, go and tell the Biſhop I live by eating ſuch good Beef.</p>
            <p>Whether the Non-Conformiſts have more or leſs, bleſſed be the Self-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and All-ſufficient <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that they stand not to the mercies of their Enemies for their preſent ſustenance, and comforts: Let his Name be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and celebrated for ever: Let Heaven and Earth be filled with his Praiſes: Let ſacrifices of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be continually offer'd up, and ſongs of the higheſt gratitude and thankfulneſs continually poured forth unto him; that they are not neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to beg their bread from door to door, and especially at the doors of their Enemies, (ſome whereof have
<pb facs="tcp:108256:19"/> heretofore begg'd their bread at theirs) and are not complaining and crying out for want of bread, and no friends to ſupply them with it.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt but the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Religion which at first (when they could have no rational prospect of a livelihood and ſubſiſtance in the world) obliged them unto, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd them in the way of Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, doth ſtill, as another ſoul, act the Generality of them unto perpetual and conſtantly progreſſive Motions, a steady and reſolute perſeverance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and produce an invincible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible non-compliance with (till they ſee better grounds, and clearer reaſon for the contrary than yet they have done) an apprehended error and evil.</p>
            <p>All the Non-conforming Party are not men of ſneaking and ſordid Spirits, ſome are as highly and truly generous and noble, as thoſe that do moſt debaſe and vilifie them; and it's very irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb facs="tcp:108256:19"/> and ingrateful unto ſuch to live after an Eleemoſynary manner, dependently upon others, which too frequently proſtitutes and expoſeth them to a contemptuous and ſlighting carriage of ſome even among their own Party, very unbecoming and unſuitable to the notions of their Function, which God never appointed to be either conſtituted or ſupported by riches, or to be built upon ſome lofty (though quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and level'd) Mountain and Pyramid of worldly dignities and Grandeurs, or the higheſt coacervation of any earthly fading Glories. I know the Conſideration of this hath been more a temptation to ſome of them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, than all their other ſufferings, or any avaritious greedy deſire to accumulate and heap up theſe lower periſhing Treaſures, but the conſideration of their auty to God, the fear of diſpleaſing and diſhonoring him, the reſignation of their Wills, not onely to his preceptive, but providential Will to be diſpoſed of by him, and provided for in ſuch a way as he in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and unerring Wiſdom thinks beſt and fitteſt for them, hath efficaciouſly attemper'd and fram'd their ſpirits hereto, and wrought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential acquicſcence in the ſame, whereby they ſtill conquer the Temptation.</p>
            <p>But to cloſe up this Diſcourſe (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is not pleaſing to the Palate, nor grateful to the Gusto of every one) would we be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:108256:20"/> with ſome rational account how theſe Non-conformiſts came with ſo much Promptitude and Readineſs, with ſo much Alacrity and Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to forſake their Benefices and preſent Livelyhoods; when Senſe and carnal Reaſon could make no diſcovery of, and way wherein they ſhould be provided for: I ſhall only briefly offer this; that as they were men that had Preacht up frequently, and zealouſly preſt and urg'd others to live by Faith (a life ſo vilyſied and contemn'd by, and unknown (as to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and uſefulneſs) unto many, yea the far greateſt part of the World) ſo that they would hereby give a clear demonſtration that they could live upon their own Doctrine, that they were no ſtrangers to this moſt ſweet and ſure, and noble conquering life. That they have their own ſouls principled with that faith which is <hi>The Subſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> That they can fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly depend upon, and confidently truſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely who knows how, the Almighty, and All-ſufficient, who can and is able, the moſt merciful and faithful God who will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly take care of, and provide for them. By this Faith can they ſuck in the exuberant ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his most precious promiſes. And would you farther know how they came to find ſo many bountiful Friends and Benefactors; I may tell you: one reaſon is Gods bleſſing his Word and
<pb facs="tcp:108256:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> Doctrine which they Preach, making it take place in the hearts of ſo many which begets a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and pure love towards them; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe His Truth, which obligeth him ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fulfil that Promiſe (which is worth more than all the Crowns, and Kingdoms in the world) <hi>Mat. 19.29.</hi> with many others that are their choiſeſt and chiefeſt Cordials, as <hi>Pſal. 3 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108256:23"/> Both becauſe all Antient Greek Writers, and alſo divers Latine, have conſtantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it, as alſo the Superſcriptions of the Greek Teſtaments hold forth this Title. And many learned Divines who have been curious, and laborious in their inveſtigation and ſearch; affirm that all Greek Copies (ſave one) bear this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iion.

               <p>The Apoſtles mind was very intent, and operous, his thoughts moſt ſolicitous, how to prevent their dangerous tergiverſations, and retrograde motions in the ways of truth.

Their Countenances were not fallen, nor did they bewray, or diſcover a dejected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, or any inward perturbations of ſpirit, neither were they the <hi>Index</hi> of any paſſionate concuſſions, and commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or diſorders in their ſouls.

Not any toy or trifle; not any minute, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable good; but grand and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent; moſt momentous, and weighty: it's a ſubſtance, a better ſubſtance, one in heaven, and abiding. (Such a Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal climax, and gradation is here) It's a ſubſtance, as if the goods they loſt were but ſhadows, if compared herewith. A ſubſtance therefore better than they. It's a ſubſtance in heaven which is not without its Emphaſis, (of which more hereafter) it's likewiſe permanent, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo better than the other which is fleeting, and fading. This exact and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſcription of the object is given by the Apoſtle you ſee.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> a <hi>Subſtance.</hi> This it muſt be, we cannot rationally ſupoſe they could part joyfully with what is counted <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> in, and by the world (like the Dog in the Fable) for that which is but a ſhadow, and hath no reality in it; or is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108256:30"/> but an inſignificant image of a real good. Senſual Souls, and earthly-minded men who are moſt concern'd to pleaſe their bruitiſh fleſh; and gratifie their ſenſes; while they neglect, are unconcern'd, and inſolicitous for the happineſs of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſpirits; they indeed eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue ſhadows that fly from them; and fly from a real ſubſtance (even the ſupream good) that doth purſue them, and would gladly be elected, and choſen by them. But Heaven-born-ſouls have not their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo debilitated, and dethron'd, nor can be guilty of ſuch monſtrous madneſs, and prodigious folly. Thoſe that are divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuminated cannot ly under ſuch groſs miſtakes concerning their true, and adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate happineſs, or conceive falſe and deluſive Idea's of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> a <hi>better Subſtance.</hi> As always good, either real, or apparent is the object of a mans love, deſire, and choice; ſo it is an apprehended at leaſt, if not a certainly known <hi>Meliority</hi> of good, (either under a ſpecifick, or gradual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration) that induceth and prevails with us to chooſe it before another, and to ſhew our preference of it, by parting with the other in corrivalſhip for the ſame. When two good things are judged exactly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108256:31"/> to be equal, and a preponderation, (when they are weighed in the ballance of our judgments, can be aſcribed to neither of them) then the ſame right reaſon that doth dictate to us at firſt, and bring us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its regal and powerful commands to chooſe good before evil; tells us likewiſe it's as good and convenient for us to keep, and adhere to what we are for preſent in poſſeſſion of, as to part with it for that which doth no way excel, or can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng a ſuperiority to it.

If once Faith be foyl'd and conquer'd, a Chriſtian quickly gives over fighting, and ſuffering: then inſtead of forſaking the world, there will be a forſaking of God, and Chriſt.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108256:37"/> our motions heavenwards, and to the full fruition of God himſelf, ſhould be invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and progreſſive in. Had all Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors that Faith which doth moſt firmly and invincibly believe the reality of the future Glory; and that penetrates, and pierceth into Heaven, and Eternity, through all dark interpoſing clouds here below, giving the ſoul a view, and proſpect of the ſame, realizing, and ſubſtantiating it as preſent to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. I ſay, had all Profeſſors ſuch a Faith, not one of them to ſave an Eſtate, an Inheritance, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this world, (although it conſiſted of all Imperial Crowns, and Kingdoms) would ever deny the Truth (I mean total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and finally) and diſown the pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, or turn away from that moſt abſolute, and perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs which Divine Laws do Conſtitute, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. but would rejoycingly, and triumphantly perſevere to ſuffer for theſe high and precious things; that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation of his ſoul depends upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To <hi>know</hi> is to be aſſured, if not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet in ſome degree, and meaſure, that this better and permanent Subſtance ſhall be ours. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> knew, that is, as was ſhewed in the opening of the words
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108256:38"/> before, they were aſſured that they had ſuch a Subſtance. A well grounded aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Heaven, though it be not abſolutly perfect, will make thoſe Souls where it is very cheerfully, and joyfully to ſuffer. And to know, and to be aſſured in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſometimes for ſenſe, and ſignification, are the ſame, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. For we <hi>know, i. e.</hi> we have an aſſurance <hi>that if our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternally in the Heavens.</hi> and this the <hi>Hebrews</hi> knew, <hi>i. e.</hi> of this they had an aſſurance, when their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habitations were taken from them: but having ſpoken ſomething to this already, I will not ampliate, and enlarge the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe here any farther.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is it that we muſt know in our ſelves? this, as hath been ſhewed in the opening of the words, is not without its Emphaſis, two things then it ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; the one whereof hath been in part ſpoken to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A lively hope of poſſeſſing this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance according to ſuch a knowledg, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, belief, and aſſurance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. By knowledg Chriſtians reflect upon their hope, from whence ſprings their joy. There is a natural connection betwixt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108256:38"/> theſe two, as betwixt the Streams and the Fountain, the Beams and the Sun, which flow from the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Rejoycing in the hope of the glory of God.</hi> Though Good be not in actual poſſeſſion, yet ſo long as it's an object of hope, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the apprehended worth of that good, and the ſtrength of that hope is ſtill our joy. Hope is unexpreſſibly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a religious ſoul in reſpect of comfort when ſhe grounds her ſelf upon Eternity, and upon an Aſſured futurity which we are promiſed in the holy Scriptures, and not upon that uncertain futurity which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſeth moſt men, and at laſt deceives all. They that thus know <hi>in themſelves,</hi> know experimentally, and believingly what the ſweet benign influences of hope (while it hath this enduring Subſtance for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) are upon their Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Something inherent, and wrought in them, upon which all the other are grounded. To <hi>know in our ſelves,</hi> is to have or find in our ſelves that which may be a ſure ground for us infallibly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from, that we have this Subſtance, which is better, and abiding in Heaven. As a vital Principle of Grace, or a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſpiritual lite ruling, and governing the ſoul, and acting it towards God, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108256:39"/> through change of our Natures, and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of our Spirits, the transforming energy, and vertue of the ſpirit of God to have paſt upon our ſouls: the deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a divine nature thereupon whereby we are aſſimulated, and made like to God. Whoſoever hath not his hope and expectation of an heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs built, and bottom'd upon this, doth but deceive himſelf, and will find his hope to prove abortive, and his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt miſerably, and deplorably fruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the end. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Which is Chriſt in you, the hope of Glory.</hi> This is that we muſt know and find in our ſelves, before we can challeng a right and title unto, and conclude that this immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Subſtance belongs to us; and ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be poſſeſſed by us. To <hi>know in our ſelves</hi> ſeems conſonant to that, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf.</hi> Which is not only (if there be any ſuch thing) that witneſs, and teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt in a more immediate way, but an inherent Principle of Grace, and Holineſs, firſt powerfully planted, and wrought by the ſpirit of God in the ſoul; and then halp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and enabling the ſoul to reflect upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108256:39"/> it, and find it out; and after this, to draw right and comfortable concluſions from the ſame, which ſtand as a witneſs, and evidence in our ſouls, that we have a right to all that future Glory, and felicity, that ſuch a changing renewing Principle doth adapt and qualify us for, and render us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. And if I may allude to that which is ſpoken of our Saviour in the very ſame words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.61. thereby expreſſing his omniſciency, <hi>knowing in himſelf,</hi> it will illuſtrate this to be the ſenſe thereof; for how did Chriſt know in himſelf; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. but by <hi>that fulneſs of the Godhead that dwelt in him, <gap reason="foreign">

So to <hi>know in our ſelves,</hi> is to know by ſome in-dwelling Purity, and Holineſs in our Souls, that we have this better Subſtance.

I have been larger upon this than ſome perhaps will judg pertinent, and neceſſary; but the reaſon why I am ſo, is becauſe ſo many either from Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Atheiſm that is in them (though they do not profeſs it) or becauſe they are Entheuſiaſtically infatuated, moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, and irrationally aſſert (and are very induſtrious to propagate ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) that there is no <hi>Local</hi> Heaven, and that God is not to be enjoyed more in one place than in another. The affirming this Subſtance to be in Heaven implies, and includes theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The certainty of its poſſeſſion. It's no Poetical fiction or fable; it's no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> but ſo certainly as there is a Heaven (than which nothing is more certain) ſo certainly is there this moſt ſubſtantial bleſſedneſs to be enjoyed by the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108256:45"/> Saints. <hi>Certainly,</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> are diſtinct, A good may be real, but yet not certain, becauſe that reſpects either our knowledg, or enjoyment of it, or both. To ſay it's a Subſtance as hath been already ſhewd, proves the reality of the Saints felicity, but to ſay it's in Heaven, expreſſeth the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of an enjoyment, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. If a man ſay to his Friend and Favourite, I will beſtow upon thee a Treaſure that affords ſome comfort, and is a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of kindneſs; but it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of all doubts: for the queſtion may ſtill be put; how ſhall I come by it? and where is it? But if the Reply be, go to ſuch a Chamber, or Cheſt, here is the Key that opens it, take it into your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, then it's certain it ſhall be his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition it's a real Treaſure, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance indeed, and the perſon be ſerious when he makes ſuch an offer, and promiſe. Now the Children of God do not only know that they have a Subſtance, and Treaſure, but they know the very place where it is, they know where to find it, and take poſſeſſion of it, it's certain and ſure to them; they have the word of a faithful God for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The furutity of it. Here is no poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, it is not attainable in this life.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108256:45"/> God doth not intend a perfect happineſs for his Saints here upon earth; or that they ſhall have no better, and higher bleſſedneſs than what is to be enjoyed in this world. Here they are not to be rewarded fully for their ſufferings, and loſſes for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Religions ſake. But here they muſt expect a conſtant ſucceſſion of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and trials, like the Waves of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean following ſpeedily one another; and an uninterrupted <hi>Series</hi> of Afflictions, Croſſes, and Sorrows. No conſtant Calm, nor ſerene ſtate is to be expected for the faithful Servants of God in theſe lower <hi>Regions:</hi> Storms will ariſe, and continue till they come to the Harbours mouth; they will accompany them to their very Arrival at the Haven of everlaſting <hi>Reſt, Act.</hi> 14.22. Here they live by hope, the <hi>object</hi> whereof is not a preſent, but a future good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. and not ſuch a good whoſe futurity is in time, but eternity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. While Gods Children are in this world they are <hi>Minors,</hi> like Heirs under age that muſt not take poſſeſſion of their Inheritance, it's reſerved in Heaven for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. They have much laid up under hope, but little in hand; the higheſt, and greateſt things under expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but little in poſſeſſion. Their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108256:46"/> is as a <hi>Reverſion</hi> after this life. Their right and title thereunto is clear, and made ſure; but till they come to die, God ſaith not, go up and poſſeſs the good <hi>Land.</hi> God indeed ſometimes for <hi>Cordials,</hi> and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-comforts when they have their bitter cups to drink, and their fainting fits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, gives them ſome praeguſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fore-taſts of the immixt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Heaven, and a delightful raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſpect and fore-view of its Glory, and Bleſſedneſs, a diſtillation thereof of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is of ſome few drops from the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ocean, and a ſecret influx of ſome leſſer <hi>Rivolets</hi> from the everflowing, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiline</hi> fountain of joy, upon their Spirits. Sometimes they have their firſt <hi>fruits,</hi> but the full harveſt, and perfection of all is Heaven it ſelf, which is future and to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Inviſibility</hi> of it to outward ſenſe. This Heaven not being expos'd to the view of ſenſe, this Subſtance which is in it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen: if the Cabinet be not viſible, the Jewels in it cannot be beheld. God will not have the Saints ineſtimable, &amp; chiefeſt Treaſure to be ſeen, and diſcerned by their bodily eyes, but by the ſpiritual enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned eye of Faith, which it is the proper object of. The ſufferings of the Saints
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108256:46"/> would not be ſo highly laudable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, could they by external ſenſe ſee the glorious reward that they muſt fetch their encouragment from, to endure the ſame. God will have their Spirits ſteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtrengthned; their Souls fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; their hearts enboldned, and raiſed to an high pitch of invincible Magnanimity, from an inviſible crown; and all for the tryal and exerciſe of Faith; the ſweet, and ſure, and noble life whereof, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends (as he hath enjoynd it by an irrepeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Law) they ſhall live, while they are the Inhabitants of this lower World. The Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. tell us they muſt not live by ſight but by Faith, God promiſeth them great things; his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Are exceeding great, and pretious, ſo they are ſubjectively, and in reſpect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof. And God will prove and try who among the many thouſands that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be Chriſtians; will take his word, and truſt him firmly; and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; and immoveably depend thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And who by a belief of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the excellency of good that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed, at ſo great a diſtance and not ſeen, can leave, and quit chearfully, and joyfully a good that is preſent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108256:47"/> things viſible by the ſight of things inviſible. Did all that profeſs themſelves Believers really live by Faith, then none would in a day of temptation faint, and finally fall away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live</hi> by <hi>Faith;</hi> which implies ſmal perſeverance, for it's ſtands oppoſed to drawing back, which the want of Faith is the cauſe of, and all a Chriſtians Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts over the World, are aſcribed to Faith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. The Reaſon of this is, becauſe Faith (which ultimately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it ſelf into the Authority, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of divine Revelations and Promiſes) makes what is inviſible as viſible to the Soul. It's of ſuch an evidencing Nature, and property, and doth ſo ſubſtantiate, &amp; bring into a real exiſtence, that eternal felicity which is the object of the Saints hope; that it hath a moſt powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Soul to abandon, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all viſible, and finite good, and the higheſt terene Felicities, and worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments that come in competition with the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Now Faith is the</hi> ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>things</hi> not ſeen. The word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108256:48"/> ſame. The Apoſtle further ſhews us that things not ſeen, are ſo clearly ſeen and lookt upon by believing; that the Soul is kept from fainting, and ſinking under the moſt ponderous Preſſures, and mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous loads of Troubles; and the moſt cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burdens of all Croſſes, and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. This made <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to endure ſo reſolutely and couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. To ſee what is not ſeen; to have that viſible which is inviſible, is a ſtrange Paradox, yea and ſeems to imply a groſs contradiction to ſenſual Souls, and earthly minded men. It's a myſtery they cannot plum, or fathome the depth of. If at any time notionally, or by the report of others they ſpeak, and diſcourſe of it, it's but as a blind man doth of the beauty, and brightneſs of Sun, and Moon, and Stars, which is inviſible to him: but to believing Souls, that are not <hi>immerſt</hi> in ſenſuality, and buried in the Earth, but have a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Viſive faculty, ſuted and proportion'd to a Spiritual object, it's as clear a truth as any thing, that's moſt demonſtrable in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yea its more clear, &amp; certain then many things are by ocular demonſtration, becauſe the bodily Eye is capable of deception, and hath many times a fallacy put upon it, which Faith is never liable to; becauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108256:48"/> it depends upon the word, and promiſe of the unerringly, infallibly wiſe, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God. The Enemies of pure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Religion, and the divinely inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and authorized worſhip of God (whoſe Souls lye under the Dominion of their Senſes) and many carnal Hypocritical Profeſſors (in whoſe hearts Earth, and not Heaven is moſt regnant, the World, and <hi>inferiour good,</hi> and not God, the Supream good, hath the prevailing, and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant intereſt) they wonder at the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe, and highly cenſure, and accuſe them of the groſſeſt, and moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous folly, that will hazard, and part with their Eſtates, and Spontaneouſly, and eligibly make themſelves poor for the Goſpel ſake (as theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> did) rather then to poſſeſs all Earthly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures without it. They think them (for ſo doing) deprived of all Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtrangly inſatuated, or under ſome great deluſion (that calls for pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration) or that too much Religion hath made them <hi>delirious.</hi> For as no man in his right Wits will refuſe Riches when they court him to an acceptance; ſo they judge none but a Fool, unleſs he be forced, will part with them. Theſe men (who alwayes make their Conſciences ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108256:49"/> to their intereſt, and are reſolved to walk no further in the way to Heaven, then it's plain and ſmooth, and may conſiſt with the caſe of the Fleſh and the Security of their Poſſeſſions) admire, and adore the depths of their own Wiſdom, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (as they call it) out of which they can draw ſubtil diſtinctions as they liſt, to baffle the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And indeed they judge all men Fools, that cannot diſtinguiſh themſelves out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; either to get or improve, or keep an eſtate hereupon Earth. But were this moſt ſubſtantial bleſſedneſs conſpicable, and could it be ſteddily beheld with their Eyes; yea, had they but the leaſt tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent view, and ſmalleſt momentary glimps thereof, they would then be aſtoniſhed, and confounded at their own monſtrous ſottiſhneſs, and matchleſs folly, to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the loſing of the ſame, for ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying trifle as an earthly Eſtate, and Treaſure is; and would no leſs admire the wiſdom of true Believers in the choice, which they have made. But although no ſuch view, and ſight they ſhall be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; neither will God take ſuch a courſe to convince them of theſe things;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108256:49"/> yet when they come into another World, where this Heavenly ſubſtance ſhall be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to them, that they may know, and feel how great their loſs is, (when they meet with an eternal ſeparation from the ſame) and have their miſery highly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated thereby; then they will confeſs that living by Faith was the higheſt point of true wiſdom; then ſhall they know to their everlaſting ſhame, and ſorrow that the Eye of Faith (formerly deſpiſed, and derided by them) could penetrate, and look through the thickeſt Clouds of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the moſt black midnight dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Calamities, into the higheſt Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Regions, to view that glory, and bleſſedneſs which is there, but to all other eyes inviſible. Then ſhall they befool them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and form a furious Reflexion upon their former madneſs, begin to tear, and torment themſelves; as it is in 5. Chapter of Wiſdom. from Ver. 1. to 14. <hi>Then ſhall the Righteous ſtand in great boldneſs, before the Face of ſuch as have tormented him, and taken away his labours. When they ſee him, they ſhall be vexed with horrible fear, and ſhall be amazed for his wonderful delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And ſhall change their minds, and ſigh for grief of mind: Say within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; this is He Whom we ſometimes had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108256:50"/> in deriſion, and in a Parable of Reproach. We Fools thought his life madneſs, and his end without honour. How is He counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Children of God, and his Portion is among the Saints? Therefore we have erred from the way of Truth; and the light of Righteouſneſs hath not ſhined in us, and the Son of understanding roſe not upon us. We wearied our ſelves in the way of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and deſtruction; yea, we have gone thorow Deſarts, where there lay no way: But as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it. What hath Pride profited us? or what good hath Riches with</hi> our <hi>vanting brought us? All thoſe things are paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a ſhadow, and as a Post that hasted by. And as a Ship that paſſeth over the Waves of the Water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Path way of the Keel in the Waves. Or as when a Bird hath flown thorow the Air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light Air being beaten with the ſtroke of her Wings, and parted with the violent noiſe and motion of them, is paſſed thorow, and therein afterwards no ſign where ſhe went is to be found. Or like as when an Arrow is ſhot at a Mark, it parteth the Air, which immediately cometh together again: So that a Man cannot know where it went thorow
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108256:50"/> Even ſo in like manner, as ſoon as we were born, began to draw to our end, and had no ſign of vertue to ſhew: but were conſumed in our own wickedneſs.</hi>

It's true, a full proper, and imme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diate ſight of the immenſe divine eſſence there cannot be, for that being infinite can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be comprehended by a viſine faculty,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 17.</note> which is but finite (as finite objects may, whoſe ſplendor doth not over power its ſtrength) and it being likewiſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created immaterial, and ſpiritual object, ſo it muſt be inviſible to a corporeal Eye, for it's ſight being united to the object, by the help of the ſenſible Species, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſimilitudes or Image of the object, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence cannot be viſible to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's impoſſible for a thing created to repreſent that which is increated; as a created Species to repreſent an increated object, or a material Species an immaterial object, and to aſſert the contrary would be to make the divine Eſſence a created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for then there would be ſome other

               <p>This is the Reaſon why that clear ſight of God, which is called the <hi>Beatifical Viſion</hi> (becauſe it makes the <hi>Seer</hi> bleſſed) is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intellectual, and thus the Saints in glory are ſaid to ſee the divine Eſſence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.7. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. but now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly, but then Face to Face (that is now we ſee imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but then we ſhall ſee immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that the great object ſeen now and then, is the ſame) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>As for me I will behold thy Face,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>In Heaven the Angels do always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Face of my Father.</hi> This beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion is ſuch a ſight of God, as is oppoſite to the ſight of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. that ſight then being immediate, the ſight of him in the ſtate of bleſſedneſs (as the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> in that reſpect to the other) will be immediate. By this, ſhall the Soul ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine the <hi>Eſſence</hi> apprehenſively (according to it's finite created, but then enlarged and perfected capacity of the underſtanding) ſo as it cannot proceed further in point of knowledge concerning God, or that great Queſtion <hi>What</hi> God is. But though this <hi>felicitating</hi> Viſion be principally that of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108256:55"/> the Soul, yet the Scripture ſeems to hold forth that ſo much of the <hi>divine</hi> glory ſhall beam forth to the glorified corporeal Eye to behold, as ſuch a Creature is capable of, for delighting it in a moſt wonderful raviſhing manner; for the Divine eſſence being an Arbitrary, and voluntary Glaſs, he may according to his good pleaſure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt more or leſs of ſuch a viſible glory, to the Eyes of Saints in Heaven. And why may there not be ſuch a corporeal Viſion, or ocular Veiw of the Face of God in this ſenſe, ſeeing <hi>Jacob</hi> had it (though in a lower degree becauſe his mortal ſtate would not bear ſuch a ſight as is proper to a ſtate immortal) upon Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.30. I have ſeen, ſaith he, <hi>God,</hi> Face to Face, though it was not God's Eſſence that was diſcernable at that time, yet, beſides that humane form, and ſhape that God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in (and which at firſt might make him think it was but a man,) before he left <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> (beſides his ſolemn bleſſing him) it's very probable he gave ſome demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Divinity, which it's likely was by ſome glorious appearance, or reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and bright manifeſtation of himſelf (ſo much as he was then capable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to his Eye ſight, this made him ſay I have ſeen <hi>God Face to Face, and yet my life
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108256:56"/> is preſerved.</hi> Such a ſight <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> &amp;c, had of God in the <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And they ſaw the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> how? by the effulgency and ſhining forth of ſome glory, and brightneſs which was obvious to their ſenſe, by which they might perceive that God was preſent in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and extraordinary manner, this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what follows. And there was under his Feet as it were a paved work of a Saphir Stone (which is a Stone of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear Sky colour) and as it were the body of Heaven in it's clearneſs, or in it's brightneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates God that he would ſhew him his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhew me thy glory, which is not to be underſtood of God's eſſence (which no doubt he knew to be inviſible) but his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory. While God was ſpeaking with him by a ſenſible Voice, his preſence was over-ſhadowed with ſome Cloud, or darkneſs, ſo that this glory did not appear and therefore now he deſired either the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the interpoſing Cloud, or that his glory might break through it to be objected to his ſenſe. God in the 19. verſe. replies to this Petition thus. I will make my <hi>goodneſs</hi> paſs before thee, that is I my ſelf will paſs before <hi>thee</hi> and with my ſelf all my goodneſs, and glory,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108256:56"/> but ſeeing it is too much for thee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, it ſhall therefore paſs, and not ſtay for thee to gaze upon, it ſhall paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or by thee that thou mayeſt ſee a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it behind. That which <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo deſirous to ſee, was the Divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fully manifeſted, and diſplayed; now God tells him that this ſtate of defiled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and mortallity was not capable of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Now that <hi>Moſes</hi> might know that God was not unkind to him, while he denied to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his requeſt, he tells him plainly in the 20. <hi>v. He could not ſee his Face without the peril, and hazard of his life.</hi> And he ſaid thou canſt not ſee my <hi>Face,</hi> (which is not only to be underſtood of God's ſpiritual Majeſty, which is altogether inviſible, but likewiſe, if not principally in this place of that brightneſs and glory which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth his preſence, and that he is cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as with a Garment.) For there ſhall none ſee <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>live.</hi> From theſe words the principal objection may be raiſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any ocular views, or corporeal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God in Heaven: For ſeeing in Heaven the Saints ſhall have their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108256:57"/> nature, and not ceaſe to be men, how can they ſee any thing of him there, more than here, and live. To which it may be replied, that either ſuch a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God is not in this life, but in the other, that if a man would ſee God, he muſt firſt die, and then he ſhall ſee (as it were) face to face; and ſo the ſence of the words is this; No man while he <hi>lives</hi> in a mortal condition here upon earth, can ſee my face: which interpretation I do not approve of (becauſe it contradicts other Scriptures already ſpoken to and explain'd) without another, which is; That the full manifeſtations of my glory are too much for mans infirmity to bear, and apprehend: Thus for man to ſee me, would ſo aſtoniſh him, as to make him a dead man, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.8, 9. This is that glory which <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee, which God tells him he was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of beholding, as he was a meer mortal man. But yet it's clear from verſ. 23. that God did manifeſt ſo much of his glory to him as was ſufficient for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning, and for his deſire. When he ſaith <hi>thou ſhalt ſee</hi> my back-parts, he ſpeaks here as if he appeared in humane ſhape at this time, who though he hid his glory from <hi>Moſes</hi> his eyes (as if an hand
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108256:57"/> had been ſpread over his face to cover him) while he paſſed before him, yet was he priviledged with a glimpſe of his glory coming after, behind he might ſee him as in a ſhadow. And it's probable when <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> (where he had been forty days, and forty nights without food, with God) with a ſhining luſtre upon his face, it was from a reflexion of a divine glory and ſplendor upon it, which he was in ſome conſiderable degree enabled and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to behold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28, 29, 30. We find that in the Mount, when Chriſt was transfigur'd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.2.9.2. and his face and countenance irradiated with coeleſtial glory, yet thoſe Diſciples which were with him, had ocular views of it, though in reſpect of their mortal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they could ſcarce bear and endure the ſparkling rayes thereof, but ſeem to be aſtoniſhed, while wonderfully raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delighted with the ſame. Now if the eye of God's Saints have had ſuch glympſes of Divine Glory upon earth, what clearer and fuller view will they have thereof in heaven, when their viſible faculty and organ of ſight ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably invigorated, and made a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand degrees more pure, and piercing,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108256:58"/> more acute and quick than now it is: And if a ſmall beam, or glympſe thereof was ſo delectable to <hi>Peter, John,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> that were with Chriſt in the Mount that they were loath to leave it, but were very deſirous to take up their abode there; how infinitely more pleaſant and raviſhing will thoſe more open, and ample mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Glory be? and though we cannot determine what the meaſures thereof will be, yet we may conclude it will infinitely more ſurpaſs the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and Loves-moſt powerful attractive objects upon earth, than either the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Meridian Sun, that minute and little light, that acts the part of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in a Glow-worm.</p>
               <p>We may rationally ſuppoſe likewiſe, that the ſight of Chriſt, as he is man, with all the inherent coeleſtial qualities of his moſt glorious body, will render heaven a place full of delectableneſs. This muſt be the next object to the Beatifical Viſion it ſelf.

The wiſe man tells us, <hi>The eye is never ſatisfied with ſeeing,</hi> Eccl. 1.8. Although it may be wearied with look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108256:60"/> upon various objects, yet it is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but ſtill deſires new ones, and can drink them in without ſurfeiting; ſo that though the <hi>acts</hi> of the eye be ſcant, and finite, yet the luſts of the eye ſeem to have a kind of infinity in them. Now all this ariſeth from the imperfection of all conſpicable glory and beauty in this world; for the ſight cannot be quieted, except in the moſt excellent of viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and this it only meets with in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Melancthon</hi> deſired death for this very end, that he might ſee Chriſt in glory; <hi>Cupio ex hac vita migrare propter duas cauſas, primum ut fruar deſiderato conſpectu filii Dei, &amp; Coeleſtis Eccleſiae, &amp;c.</hi> And if death be deſirable by the Saints for this end, certainly the object will be proportionably delightful.</p>
               <p>We may likewiſe rationally conceive the glorified bodies of the Saints will be very delightful objects, whoſe conſtantly flowring and radiant beauty ſhall never be incentives and baits to luſt; ſhall not beget unchaſt thoughts, nor allure and tempt to unclean embraces.

Had man continued in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that beauty which is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the moſt exact ſymmetry, and complexion, falls inconceivably ſhort of what it would then have been; and even that, before ſin darkned it's luſtre, and ſtain'd it's glory, or in the leaſt withered it's flower; was not to be compared with this. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun, in the kingdom of their father.</hi> Which may very well be underſtood (as one ſenſe, if not the chief) of their corporeal brightneſs; and it's probable, had there been a more ſplended creature in the whole viſible Creation than the Sun, our Saviour would have made uſe of it, to expreſs the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity of the Saints bodies by in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

               <p>To all that hath been ſaid, this may be added to demonſtrate the Heavenly Delectabilities, that is, the conſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted profuſions of the perfected Divine Love upon God (which includes the perfect rectitude and conformity of the ſouls wills to the Soveraign, Supreme Will of God, and its attain'd reſt in its utmoſt and perfecting end;) for as Love is the Eſſence of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8, 16. ſo Love is the Eſſence of the Soul, and the nobleſt pleaſures, and pureſt joys, are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108256:66"/> fetcht in, and conveyed by love into it: every man by ſenſe and feeling knows what a ſecret emanation of ſweetneſs there is from a good that's loved. Its by Love, that every good communicates it ſelf to our ſouls, and they are made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a participation thereof, by; and the greater the good is, (provided the actings of love be proportion'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) the greater and ſweeter are the pleaſures that ſpring from it. God then being the ſupreme Good, and that Good which for its perfection comprehends all other good, what plentiful delights muſt reſult, and be derived from it, when ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely and perfectly lov'd in Heaven? This it that which will make the joys of glorified Saints, to flower, and ſpring up for ever.</p>
               <p>When love is not mutual, and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, when it is not reflected back again, and the ſoul cannot hear the pleaſant, and earneſtly expected <hi>Eccho</hi> (I love thee) from the amorated object: And when no alternate exerciſes of this paſſion can be perceived, then many times it produceth ſtrange inquietudes, and perturbations of mind, exceſs of grief, beſotting Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, reſtleſs commotions of ſpirit, and ſometimes wearineſs of ones preſent life,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108256:67"/> and being, and then its ſo far from being the cauſe of the Amoriſts felicity, that it creates his greateſt miſery; and when all its hopes of a ſutable reſponſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from its object are exſpired, then it turns into loathing, and the higheſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of, and revengeful fury againſt the ſame. And not only ſo, but exceedingly tortures, and proves prodigiouſly, and monſtruouſly unkind to the ſoul that firſt conceived it, and brought it forth: and having obtained too great a Maſterdome over the ſoul, (enfeebled and conſumed with its flames) <hi>Nero</hi>-like, it would rip up the womb, and tear out the bowels of its own Mother. And under this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable fruſtration, and deplorable diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, its like an enrag'd man, who when he cannot be revenged upon the perſon, that hath highly affronted, and offered great indignities to him, he will tear his own hair, and fleſh, and execute his fury upon his neareſt relation, or the man that is next to him.</p>
               <p>But Heaven admits of no ſuch thing; for there the glorified Saints ſhall not, yea cannot poſſibly love God ſo much, as they ſhall be loved by him; for they love him but according to their perfect, finite goodneſs; but he loves them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108256:67"/> to his perfect, infinite goodneſs: they love him ſo far as they are made good; and he loves them ſo far as he is good: and therefore look how far his goodneſs exceeds theirs, ſo far muſt his love ſurpaſs theirs: When God therefore and they meet together in heaven, there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the higheſt endearments of love betwixt them, nothing but the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſtant actings and embracements of Love, in the very boſom of God's Love ſhal their pure and holy ſouls be lodged for ever. O how ſweet, and pleaſant will that Heaven be, where perfect created, and perfect intreated love ſhall meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; were the Saints ſhall never doubt more, whether or no they do love God ſincerely, (that is, prevalently and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely) which occaſions many perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts, many inquiries into, and much deep ſearching of their hearts here, leaſt after all their higheſt pretences, and profeſſions, they ſhould prove and periſh as hypocrites for ever: And then ſhall all their perplexing doubts, and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fears that they are not loved by God, ceaſe: No ſuch complaints as we read of in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7, 8, 9. and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16. ſhall be heard in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; There ſhall be no need of that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108256:68"/> counſel which we have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voyce of his ſervants, that ſitteth in darkneſs, and ſeeth no light: let him trust in the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God.</hi> That text, ſhall never be preach'd upon in heaven, for the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of drooping, dejected, (though holy) ſouls.</p>
               <p>And as there ſhall be nothing but Love betwixt God, and his Saints; ſo there ſhall be nothing but love among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Peeviſhneſs, and Paſſion, Miſ-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Miſ-conſtuctions, Hard-cenſures of each others Actions, Quarrelling about Property, too much Self-love, Difference in Judgments, Pride, and Emulation, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>better their Converſe, and breed too great an eſtrangedneſs among them here upon earth; but as all theſe things proceed from the weakneſs of Chriſtian and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Love, ſo when that Love is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards each other, as well as God himſelf, none of theſe things ſhall be found in heaven, to render it a place, and their ſociety unpleaſant to them.</p>
               <p>We find that too often, a few days, or hours converſe in this world, makes them weary of each others company, and they deſire to draw of, and retire, though there
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108256:68"/> be none of thoſe former things to occaſion it. And ſuch a Secluſion in ſolitude they find after converſe, very Recreating, and delightful to them. But as this ariſeth from the Languidneſs and imperfection of their Love, ſo when there is a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it in Heaven, then a whole Eternity will not make their Fellowſhip ingrateful and burdenſome, nor their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Converſes, Nauſeous and glutting, all deſires ſhall then ceaſe to Sequeſter themſelves each from other..</p>
               <p>And as there ſhall be ſuch perfect exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of love among all the Saints, ſo ſhall there be betwixt them and the Holy Angels. No doubt the love of <hi>Angels</hi> is now very ſtrong towards the Saints, which is not apprehended by them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Nature is ſo little known to them. But when they come to Heaven they ſhall have ſuch a clear knowledge thereof, that it ſhall ſtrongly <hi>Elicit,</hi> and powerfully draw forth their love to them again.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to us the co-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Angels and Saints in the ſame Heaven,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8.5.8.7.9.</note> and as they do dwell together, ſo we may rationally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108256:69"/> they converſe, and love together for the Soul of the Saints being of a ſpiritual ſubſtance, they and the Angels are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſpeaking one to another; that is mentally, (though not vocally) in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſpiritual manner, communicating their minds, notions, meanings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as they ſee cauſe, and as they pleaſe each to other. But though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abſolutely, and certainly determine either how Angels ſpeak among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or how they, and humane Souls ſpeak each to other, yet we may not in the leaſt doubt, or queſtion, the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful reciprocations of love, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Caraſſes</hi> between them.</p>
               <p>Now how pleaſant is every place that is full of Love? how comfortable is it to live in a Family of Love? what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential co-habitation is that which Love is the Cementation of, where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinates, and joyns all hearts together? When conjugal Love is kept up in it's truth, and ſtrength: How delightful and unwearied a converſe is there betwixt Man and Wife? And if uniting and knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Love (according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.3.) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Communities and Societies ſo ſweet, how incomparably pleaſant then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108256:69"/> muſt Heaven be, which is perfumed throughout with Love, where Love is moſt immixt and pure, where the Love both of God, Angels and Saints meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Where Love is not only compleat, but perpetual, which ſhall never be ſhut up, and buried in the depths of ſorrows, nor breath out its laſt by violent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſeparations, as the Love of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friends and the deareſt Relations ſoon-or later doth.</p>
               <p>And hath Love ſuch a vertue in it that if Friends be caſt into a loathſome Priſon together, it can turn it into a pleaſant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, if into a dark diſconſolate Dungeon; it can ſupply the want of Light, if in a Wilderneſs, it can change it into a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. How can delights then be wanting in Heaven? what perfection of all dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctabilities muſt be there, where there is ſuch a perfect plenitude, and fulneſs of Love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Superlative Excellency, this I have ſpoken to before, and therefore ſhall not dwell long upon it now, but ſeeing its a a ſubſtance in Heaven, it muſt be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. 1. Specifically, and in reſpect of kind. This ſubſtance being in Heaven,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108256:70"/> it muſt be diſtinct from any ſubſtance here upon Earth; and as far as the Coeleſtial Bodies excel Terreſtrial, ſo far muſt this ſurpaſs the other. And being <hi>Eſſentially</hi> the very glory, and bleſſedneſs of God himſelf, what can compare with it? Not Gold, nor Pearls, nor Princes Crowns, though they could be heaped up, as high as the higheſt Mountains, or could be made to reach the Sun, and Stars; yea, the higheſt Heavens. 2. Gradually, for meaſure here is nothing wanting. Heaven imports moſt abſolute Perefection. All earthly Subſtances are defective, and imperfect, and therefore uſually they that have moſt of them, would have more, and ſeldome ſit down, and ſay they have enough. This makes Kings ſo deſirous, and induſtrious to enlarge their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Empiers, to add to their weight of, or multiply their Crowns. This makes many Rich men ſo thirſty to increaſe their Bags, and their fields. Theſe and many other things demonſtrate an intrinſick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in all Earthly Subſtances, which renders them mean, and inconſiderable, what ever eſteem men may have of them, that know no better: for of what little worth is that Drink which will not quench the thirſt? or that Meat which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108256:70"/> cannot fill and ſatisfie the ſtomach; and ſo what little value is to be put upon all theſe worldly ſubſtances, that can never fill and ſatisfie the ſoul: But when the ſoul is poſſeſt of this celeſtial ſubſtance, it ſhall ſay, I need no more, nor no other: According to that <hi>Axiome deſiderium boni imperfectioris ceſſat, acquiſito perfectiori.</hi> The ſupream excellency of this ſubſtance is Rhetorically ſet forth, and diſplayed by the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. where its called a weight of glory, to ſhew the abundance and greatneſs of it, and ſuch an one as is far more exceeding. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is the Original, and its ſuch an emphatical Graeciſm, that other tongues cannot, word by word, expreſs it to the full; therefore they are neceſſitated to uſe other words and phraſes, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all compariſon; as <hi>Mire ſupra mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Eraſmus, ſupra modum in ſublimitate, Vulg. Lat. Excellenter Excellens, Beza.</hi> Exceedingly excelling, a moſt excellent, the Dutch Annot. and as our tranſlation hath it, a <hi>far</hi> more <hi>exceeding:</hi> the Greek moſt properly is, A weight of glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to excellency unto excellency. Its as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, that all Hyperbolical expreſſions fall far ſhort of this glory; ſuch is the tranſcendent
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108256:71"/> excellency of it. Much might be ſpoken of it, but when all is ſaid that the moſt Florid and Rhetorical Tongues of Men or Angels can, it will but diſparage it. And when the Saints come to poſſeſs it, they will ſay as the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sheba</hi> did concerning <hi>Solomons</hi> glory: The half <hi>of it</hi> was not told them. Finite created good is uſually better in the expectation then fruition; but infinite increated good is infinitely better in the fruition, than it can be in the expectation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This ſhews that the happineſs of the Soul is <hi>local.</hi> It is not every where, not any where, but limited, and confined to a particular place, and that this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is diſtinct from Heaven it ſelf, as much as a Treaſure is from the place where it is laid up, or a man from the Room where he lodgeth. There are a Generation of men (as hath been already ſaid, and ſpoken to in part) that would poſſeſs the World with a beleif, that all the Heaven, or Hell there is, is within a man, that is, all happineſs or all miſery, that he ſhall either enjoy, or ſuffer, is in his Soul, and where ever he is, and goes he carries his Heaven or Hell about with him. This is indeed a truth in a ſenſe; but as it's oppoſed to a place where the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108256:71"/> righteous ſhall be felicitated, and to that which the wicked ſhall be tormented in for ever, or where more of God ſhall be enjoyed, and a deep ſenſe of the loſs of him, and pain ſhall be felt, is a moſt groſs Error. And hereby they carry on a moſt pernicious deſign, (deſtructive to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,) endeavouring thereby to vacate Gods rational, and mortal Government of rational Creatures; that is, his ruling, and governing them in a way, conſiſting with promiſes, and threats; and ſo opening a paſſage to all Licentiouſneſs, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, to the moſt Nefarious Courſes, and profligated flagitious Practiſes in the World. Thoſe that do read and believe the Holy Scripture (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. Thoſe <hi>Oracles</hi> of God which give clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Anſwers, to all that do conſult with them about their future ſtate,) and do not pervert the proper ſenſe and meaning thereof, nor wreſt them to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; do know, that beſides the Hell; (which every awakened, enraged guilty Conſcience is; even the Hell of Hells, called therefore the <hi>Worm that never dieth,</hi> Mark 9.44. like the <hi>Vulture</hi> that the Poets fain'd was alwayes gnawing, and preying upon <hi>Prometheus</hi> his Liver while chain'd to the Mountain <hi>Caveaſus</hi>) and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108256:72"/> the Heaven within a man, (which every one hath, to whom the Love of God through Jeſus Chriſt is manifeſted, and the Remiſſion of his Sins, is Seal'd up in his moſt precious Blood) there is a Local Hell where as in a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar place the wicked ſhall be for ever tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and a Local Heaven, where they ſhall be for ever bleſſed. And this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may be ſaid to be there, as to be in no place elſe. The light of nature, doth ſo much atteſt this truth that none but ſuch as impriſon, and extinguiſh the ſame will deny it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's a <hi>Subſtance</hi> that's <hi>better:</hi> that is, bettter than any Goods the Saints can be be robbed, and bereaved of, or the hands of violence can tear from them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſpoken to, and explained in part this already, I ſhall onely add theſe two things which it involves in it. 1. What encouragement Saints have, and how reaſonable a thing it is, that they let go, and part with their Goods for pure Goſpel Religion, and the ſake of Chriſt, ſeeing they have that which is better. They have it in hope, and if they do this, they ſhalt certainly have it in fruition. Who will not part with a leſs perfect for a more perfect good? this every mans Reaſon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108256:72"/> will conſent, and agree to. Who will not part with Braſs for Gold, with pebble-Stones, or painted Glaſs for Orient Pearls, with Rags for Robes, with a poor Cottage for a Crown, and Court, with Puddle for Fountain waters? Much more highly rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal is it, to part with all earthly Treaſures, for that which is heavenly; ſeeing the diſproportion is infinitely greater. And how much do many Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion diſcover an imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impotency of Reaſon, as well as a want of Faith, and Religion it ſelf to ſtick at this; and make it a Stone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; when called thereunto; ſeeing the poſſeſſion of the one is depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other. 2. How rational the Saints joys are, when they do thus take joyfully the <hi>ſpoiling</hi> of their Goods. A Beaſt hath no reaſon to guide him in his choice or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſuit of any good, ſutable to his own Nature, hee's only conducted and led by ſenſe; hence that which ariſeth from the good, proper to ſuch unreaſonoble nature, may rather (as ſome ſay) be called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, then joy, this being thought more appropriate to reaſonable nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent beings. And though all men (as men) have a Principle of Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereut in their Souls yet are they not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108256:73"/> and guided thereby, but by ſenſe in the proſecution of good: To its dictates they hearken, and by them are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to the Mark, and end which they eagerly purſue. The Reaſon which they have works onely in a ſubſervency to ſenſe being its drudge, and Slave to form, and contrive thoſe deſigns and methods which have a tendency, and are moſt conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its pleaſures, and gratifications, and this makes moſt mens joys onely bruittiſh and ſenſitive, for what elſe can they be, while they do not ſpring from any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal choice (which can never be, when Reaſon is inclined, and byaſſed by ſenſe;) but only from pleaſing a ſenſual Appetite, and ſatisfying the ſenſitive and carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petions, ſuch as the Apoſtle enumerates in 1 Joh. 2.16. <hi>The Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being ſo, all humane joy is onely rational, when the underſtanding, and reaſon guides the noble elective facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul, (the Will) cheifly in its choice of good. And the better the good is, which under Conduct of Reaſon is thus choſen, the more rational muſt the joy be that iſſues from it. Its ſuch a joy as there is the ſtrongeſt, and beſt Reaſon for a joy
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108256:73"/> that moſt becomes, and is moſt agreeable to a rational immortal Soul.</p>
               <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that the Saints in the faithful diſcharge of their duty towards God; parting with all inferiour good; for this better Good, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it highly commends and juſtifies the rationality of their joys; reſulting from ſuch an Act, that involves a moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and wiſe choice; as any mans part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a leſſer, viſible good for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (and rejoycing in ſo doing;) before all underſtanding men would certainly do. It will not belong before all mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and painted Hypocrites, that will not hazard their Eſtates, for Goſpel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they do profeſs; (with all Senſualiſts, and Epicures,) ſhall know to their everlaſting ſhame, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the irrationallity of their joy (<hi>that's but like the crackling of Thornes under a Pot,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.6. Prov. 7.20. or like the laughing and ſinging of a Fool when he is going to the correction of the Stocks.) and how much their Reaſon was debaſed and trod under Foot by the uſurpt Dominion of ſenſe, and their bruitiſh paſſions over it; while they made choice of a fleſh pleaſing good,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108256:74"/> before this Heavenly ſubſtance; which is the commenſurate end to their immortal Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It's a ſubſtance that's laſting and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; which (as hath been noted) is it's immortal nature, and Eternal duration. Were this ſubſtance fleeting and fading, as all are here below, it were not ſo highly unvaluable, ſo eligible. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality which doth diſparage, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace all ſublunary glory, and felicity, and becauſe the faireſt and moſt fragrant Flowers of all earthly comforts, do ſo quickly wither; therefore are they ſo inconſiderable, and ſo little to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And becauſe all worldly honours are ſo ſoon Eternally clouded, and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed, are they ſo little to be admired, and doted upon: The longeſt Eternity is the Glory of this ſubſtance, and this is the Reaſon why it ſo far ſurmounts them all, it's an abiding ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Subjectively</hi> in it ſelf <hi>conſidered,</hi> thus it's always the ſame, it's not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a <hi>more,</hi> or a <hi>leſs,</hi> of Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Diminution; it's not like the Sea, that Ebbs, and Flows again, that is ſometimes higher, and ſometimes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108256:74"/> lower, nor like the Rivers that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are ſo deep, and ſwell ſo high that they overflow their bounds, and Banks, and at other times are ſo ſhallow, that they are foordable, and may be waded over; nor like the Moon that's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in her Wax, and ſometimes in her Wain; nor like a Comet that blazeth for a time, and is ſoon extinct again. But like a Fountain that is always full, or like the Sun whoſe light and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it ſelf is always the ſame, or like the Lawrel that is alwayes Green, or the enduring Scarlet that is died in Grain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Objectively,</hi> To them that once poſſeſs it; when once it's ours, it's ours for ever. Many men are thrown out of their rightful Poſſeſſions, many men are neceſſitated to part with them to prevent ſome conſiderable miſchief, and evil, and ſo to free themſelves from a greater, muſt undergo a leſſer miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But the Saints ſhall never be caſt out of theirs, or be under any Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to part with them. Sometimes Mens Earthly ſubſtance, and Treaſures do leave them, Prov. 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine Eyes upon that which is not, for Riches
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108256:75"/> certainly make themſelves wings, they fly away as an Eagle towards Heaven,</hi> Prov. 27.24. <hi>For Riches are not for ever,</hi> &amp;c. And if they do not leave them, they muſt certainly leave their Treaſures; but this Coeleſtial ſubſtance admits of no ſuch thing. It's not like an Earthly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in the Poſſeſſion of which each one ſucceeds another, that's like a Stage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Acts a part for a few dayes, and then goes of, and comes no more; to make way for another. Were it ſo in Heaven, the very foreſight of the loſs would quickly darken, and conclude their Joys, and make their Sun to ſet, and turn all their ſweetneſs into bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It would be a Hell in Heaven once to think of loſing, and leaving Heaven. As it would be a kind of Heaven to the damned, had they but once hopes of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Hell, and that the <hi>Origenists</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a thouſand years torments were but true. But O! what can we Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and blind duſt ſay, when we talk of Eternity, we may, and ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways admiring it; but there cannot by us. be any comprehending it; which is not meaſured by time; not by Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Moneths nor Years;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108256:75"/> having a continuing <hi>Now:</hi> to rejoyce, and ever rejoyce; to be happy, and ever happy; rich, and ever rich; honourable, and ever honourable; what ſweet and raviſhing words are theſe? It's this word <hi>(Everlasting)</hi> that makes this ſubſtance ſo much better than all the riches that a thouſand worlds can afford to us.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By Divine Revelation. Had not God firſt made it known to them, it could never have been known by them: but its clearly diſcovered in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108256:76"/> in the writings both of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, though more plainly and fully in the latter. Its true, the dim twi-light of Nature helps moſt men to ſome very low, imperfect and confuſed Notions, and obſcure glimmerings of a future happineſs in another world, when they depart this; but it can make no ſuch diſcovery of an Heavenly Glory and Bleſſedneſs, what it is, and wherein it conſiſts, as the word of God doth.</p>
               <p>The Heathens had their <hi>Elyſium,</hi> a place (as they conceiv'd) of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, whither they thought the ſouls of all the virtuous went after death. The Mahometans have their pleaſant Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, whither they believe their great Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> will convey the ſouls of all thoſe that live agreable to his Laws, but ſtill are groſly ignorant of the true happineſs in Heaven. All the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Philoſophers in the world by their moſt diligent and laborious inveſtigation and ſeach, cannot diſcover and find out this Myſtery, though they can ſo many rare ſecrets of Nature; Its the Goſpel that brings life and immortality to light, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifies <hi>Res ipſas occultas in lucem proferre, ſeu reddere viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108256:77"/> &amp; illuminare ipſos homines, ut qui in tenebris non poterant, ad preſentiam Lucis ipſi etiam illuſtrati, poſſint videre, Zanch.</hi> That is, to bring occult and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things into light, or render them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and to illuminate men themſelves; ſo that they who could not be ſeen at the preſence of the light, they themſelves alſo being illuſtrated might ſee. So that until the Goſpel like the Sun ſhine unto men, this immortal bleſſedneſs and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is hid, and kept ſecret, and all men are in darkneſs, and cannot poſſibly ſearch and ſeek it out, no more than a man in the darkeſt night can diſtinctly ſee thoſe objects that the light of the Sun only can clearly manifeſt. Hence till the Goſpel be ſent among a people, they are ſaid to fit in darkneſs, and in the Region of the ſhadow of death, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.79. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.15. even deathful ignorance: This is the light that ſprings up among thoſe involv'd, and envelop'd in dreadful darkneſs, which they ſee the beatitude of Heaven by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By divine illumination of the Soul: For any man to know this Heavenly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; it is not ſufficient that there be a light without to manifeſt it, but there
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108256:77"/> muſt be a light within (like an eye to the ſoul) to behold it. Let the Sun ſhine never ſo brightly; let all Clouds be chas'd and driven away, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens moſt ſerene and clear; yet a man that hath no eyes can neither behold the Sun, nor any objects it doth diſcover: So let the light of the Goſpel ſhine round about us, yet unleſs its bright and bleſſed beams break into our ſouls for their illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and illumination, we ſee nothing by it. And therefore as the Goſpel doth enlighten the <hi>object,</hi> ſo God muſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the <hi>Intellect,</hi> which is the faculty the ſoul ſees by. He muſt give the ſeeing eye, and actually enable to diſcern the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated object. Let the Goſpel be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto an Heathen, or an Heatheniſh Congregation, yet they will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the bleſſedneſs of another world is, till God in ſome meaſure ſhine into their ſouls; which is the opening of the <hi>blind</hi> eyes, and turning from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. which fully proves this truth. This is the reaſon why ſo many in the Chriſtian world, who have lived many years under the preaching of the Goſpel, yet know ſo little of the life
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108256:78"/> and immortality it brings to light: Alas! their ſouls are not from Heaven enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and though the light doth ſhine, yet their ſouls are wrapt up in Clouds, and darkneſs; and that darkneſs cannot comprehend that light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Every man, according to the meaſure, and degree of divine light that ſhines into his ſoul, forms his Notions, and conceives Idea's of the future bleſſedneſs: If his light be but common, or of a low degree; then his Notions are leſs clear, more lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid and feeble, leſs powerful and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive upon the ſoul for its change and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and riſe no higher, or proceed no farther than ſome jejune and unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate ſpeculations, (and indeed this is the reaſon why we have ſo many ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, but ſo few practical Chriſtians:) But when this light is more ſpecial and ſaving, when it ſo irradiates the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that it efficatiouſly works on the will to cauſe a choice of this object, and becomes transformative of the ſoul into the nature thereof; then are its No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions profund, and vigorous, and produce a firm belief thereof, with a frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and converſation ſutable thereunto; and no more than you can make a man
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108256:78"/> that hath his eyes in his head, and his ſight clear, believe that the Sun ſhines not at Noon-day, or that he ſees not Trees and Men diſtinct from Mountains; can you make a ſoul thus ſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned believe he is under a miſtake as to his future happineſs, or that he ſees, and knows not ſuch a ſubſtantial Glory in the other world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By Divine <hi>Promiſſion,</hi> or the Promiſe of God. Had not the faithful and true God promiſed it to them; had they not the word of a God for it, they could not know it ſhould be theirs: yea, it were ſinful preſumption for ſuch finite crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worms, and mortal defiled duſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, ſo much as to hope for it: but they have the Promiſes of God (thoſe ſure Rocks of Eternity) to be the <hi>baſis</hi> and foundation of ſuch high expectations, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, hath promiſed before the world began, Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. If we firmly believe a man to be juſt, and honeſt, when he promiſeth to lend, or give us ſo much money, or leave us ſuch an eſtate and treaſure when he dies; then we have a ſtrong confidence that it ſhall be ours, and ſay we know it ſhall be ſo.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108256:79"/> So they are theſe Promiſes of God that cannot lie, nor deceive his Saints, that give birth, and life, and ſtrength to all their hope, and makes them thus to know they have in Heaven a better and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They know they have this ſubſtance in heaven, by the purchaſe that Chriſt hath made thereof for them: As when a man hath purchaſed an eſtate, he knows then it is his, or if it be by any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for him. All men, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. are by nature the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>wrath:</hi> that is their proper portion; they are heirs of Hell by <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant-breaking Fall, and ſo by their very origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin are they deprived of all right to the Heavenly inheritance; all is forfeited into the hands of Juſtice, who is the diſſeiſor, and therefore that muſt be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the <hi>debt</hi> of the ſinner payed, before there can be either <hi>ſeiſin</hi> in Law, a right to it, or <hi>ſeiſin</hi> in fact, an actual poſſeſſion taken. And this is that which none can, or could ever do, but he that hath done it, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his moſt precious blood, the effuſion whereof was to ſatisfie the Law, whereby
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108256:79"/> their title to this moſt bleſſed inheritance is renewed, and regain'd, and actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion ſhall certainly follow for all thoſe that believe in him. This is the ſweet fruit of his ſufferings, the chief fruit of his blood: And ſo far as they know by the teſtimony of the ſpirit, and have an aſſurance; or though they have not that, but a well grounded hope, that Chriſt died for them, and their ſins for his ſake, by the infinite freeſt mercies of God are pardoned, (ſo that all the ſtricteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of vindictive juſtice are anſwer'd by him) ſo far they know they have this purchaſed poſſeſſion in Heaven, and this knowledg ſhall never prove fallacious, it ſhall never deceive them; and indeed there is nothing in Heaven will make the Inheritance more ſweet, and fill the ſouls of the glorified Saints more with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual raviſhments than to ſee clearly, and know perfectly that unmatchable Love, that engaged, and prevail'd with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to give his Son; and with the Son, ſo freely and readily to lay down his life, to purchaſe this immortal ſubſtance for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, What is it to take joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108256:80"/> the ſpoiling of our goods upon ſuch a knowledg? this muſt imply theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An act of our Wills, and a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act; the ſtrongeſt bent thereof muſt be for it. No man can rejoyce in doing or ſuffering any thing that his will (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially prevalently) is averſe to; ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy and repugnancy always hinders and prevents joy; for that always ſprings from an actual free choice, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a predominant inclination and propenſion of the Will towards the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Object. Hence it comes to paſs that no man can be happy againſt, or without the conſent of his Will. What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that many Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion, ſinfully comply with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries thereof, when there is danger to own it, when they do but hazard their Eſtates for ſo doing?

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108256:80"/> force, and commanding power over the man. Men know not what they ſay, (but deceive themſelves, and put the groſſeſt cheat upon their own ſouls) when they tell us their hearts are as much for religion, and truth, (though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer ſo much for it, and ſo reſolutely own it as others do) as the hearts of any Chriſtians are: and it's the heart that God looks to and accepts: for if they have any heart or will at all, it's but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and in a low degree; it's but a weaker inclination of the Will, ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, faint, and feeble velliety at the beſt, ſome motions of the Will that never come to the countenanced prevailing choice, and reſolution: for where this is, the imperate acts follow, and are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if there be an outward ability and power to do it; and when the defect is a <hi>cannot,</hi> then the not doing it is excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable: As far example, If a rich man have a heart for acts of Charity, and to relieve the diſtreſſed and poor, he will proportionably do it; ſtill his charity is anſwerable to his heart: and if he have an Eſtate, and do not give, he hath no heart at all, or gives not proportionably (though he give ſomething) to them;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108256:81"/> he hath but very little, his Wills is remiſs, &amp; this is his great ſin before God, and ſhall not excuſe him from Soul-damning guilt to ſay he had a Will, and Heart (and that Will God accepts of) for ſuch good Works, while he did nothing of them, are very little, but a man that hath no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to relieve the neceſſitous, or but a little one, and his charity is co-equal with and proportioned to it, and he hath a a Heart to do more (which is known to the Sercher of Hearts) but cannot, then is he not culpable, or inexcuſable, but God accepts thereof. If the Heart lead, all that have no impediment, and obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on follow. All the Members, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and faculties of a man, ſay to the heart, and will as the People to <hi>Joſhuah, chap.</hi> 1.16. <hi>All that thou commandeſt us We will do; and whither ſoever thou ſendeſt us we will go, onely the Lord be with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though a remiſs and inferiour Will under a Phyſical, and Natural conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is really a Will, and may be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet morally it is no Will, for it's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to denominate, (not being the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing choice) neither is it that God by his Law requireth, and is made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108256:81"/> of our Salvation; onely in thy ſenſe <hi>qui mavult vult,</hi> he that rather wills, that wills moſt ſtrongly; wills aright. Let us apply this to the Caſe in hand. There are many men of Eſtates (and ſome very conſiderable) who will own pure and undefiled Religion, and the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſhip of God, and pretend much Love and Zeal for the ſame, till their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates be in danger by a Rivality and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitorſhip between them; when they muſt either loſe their Eſtates wholly, or in part, or they muſt loſe their Religion, and worſhip God in a way leſs pure, or that is falſe. When it comes to this pinch, they part and ſhake hands with their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and do the latter to ſecure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the former. When this is done; that they may have ſomething to plead for themſelves, and quiet their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with, and prevent (for their ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cowardice, and Apoſtacy) their grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or raging; they ſay their Hearts are for the truth, the beſt Religion; the pureſt way of worſhiping God; and for the moſt profitable way of Preaching. And God accepts the Heart, and the Will for the Deed. O prodigious Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite! <hi>be aſtoniſhed, O yea Heavens</hi> at
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108256:82"/> this, and be horribly afraid! We will grant that theſe men have an Heart, and a Will for Religion, but it's that which is Inferiour, and not Superiour to the Will, and Volitions they have for the World, and their Eſtates, it's divided between contrary objects, and it's ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inclination is towards the more vile, and baſe, the Creature, and Earth as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to God, and Heaven; the former hath plainly their chuſing Will, for to that do they adhere moſt, and cleave the faſteſt. That Will, and Heart which they then pretend to have, is abominated, and rejected by God, (who will either have our actual choice, and the prevailing part of our Wills, or hee'l have none) and ſhall never ſtand them in ſteed, or be the leaſt helpful and advantageous, to them at the day of Judgement, to prevent their being turned into Hell, with the greateſt Oppoſers and Perſecutors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. Would this ſerve their turn, then might the groſſeſt Sinners, who live where the Goſpel is preached, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſcoveries of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, eſcape everlaſting Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe there is a willingneſs in all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108256:82"/> ſuch to be ſaved, and this willingneſs is much ſtronger in ſome then in others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that many are willing to do many things for ſalvation, and ſome to perform the whole Goſpel condition, but yet all their Wills are more ſtrongly inclined towards, ſome Luſt, or many Luſts and their actual choice is to pleaſe their Fleſh; they would have Chriſt and Heaven, but yet they would have ſome inferiour good, (that is what they judge to be ſo, though an evil, or perhaps in it ſelf it may be a natural good) either equally with, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then them. How many Avaritious, Ambitious, Libidinous, and Ebrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are there in the Chriſtian World, who will their ſalvation by Chriſt, but yet they will their particular Luſt, their Profits, and Honors, and unchaſt impure Pleaſures, and the gratifying of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Appetites, with their pleaſant Cups more, and ſo, notwithſtanding all their Wills, they eternaly periſh; did theſe men prevalently will Chriſt and Salvation, then would they part with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that comes in competion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, which is coming up to the terms and conditions thereof: to take joyfully then the ſpoiling of our goods for the ſake of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108256:83"/> Chriſt, implies as the principal, and cheif thing, the ſtrongeſt byaſs of our Wills towards Chriſt, and Heaven; for this was eligible to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and choſen by them: It was no force upon them, as in time of War; when, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of any mans will, his Goods are often taken away. But as it's ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.25. <hi>They choſe this rather than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Great Patience, Patience which is the ſtrength and power of the Soul to endure greivous things, which is the breath of the Soul, whereby it holds out long, and perſeveres in the Race of Chriſtianity to the end. To take joyfully the ſpoiling of our Goods, this muſt be in more then an ordinary meaſure, and degree in us; for one that's impatient under ſufferings, that frets, and fumes, and chaſes, and rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and railes at, and conceives revenge againſt perſecuting Enemies, can never rejoyce when thus wronged, and oppreſt: Impatiency, and ſuch joys are inconſiſtent. A Chriſtian muſt be ſo patient, as that the raging Sea of Paſſion may be ruled, the Waves of wrath appeaſed, and ſtilled, the Surges, and Billows of Fury, with all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108256:83"/> inward Storms, and Tumultations aſſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: We muſt be calm, ſedate, and compoſed within if we will rejoyce when we ſuffer for Religion. Patience is of a very great uſe, needful for the accompliſhing, &amp; atting of many things, which concern a Chriſtian, ſo particularly this Joy whereby his cauſe is ſo much honoured, without this he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey that Law, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations,</hi> nor that in 1 Pet. 4.14. <hi>But rejoyce in as much as ye are Partakers of Christs ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> This is one Reaſon among many why our Saviour exhorts Chriſtians to poſſeſs their Souls in Patience, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.19. and the Apoſtle in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.3. <hi>that Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might have her perfect work in them,</hi> ſo in the 36. ver. of this 10. of the <hi>Heb.</hi> He tells the <hi>Hebrews ye have need of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> with many other places to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Courage previous, to our ſuffering joyfully, is great boldneſs, invincible magnanimity, and mightineſs of Spirit, Puſillaminity (which by too many is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prudence) and joyful ſuffering are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent fear, and joy are exterminative, and excluſive of each other; had theſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108256:84"/> 
                  <hi>Hebrews</hi> been diſmayed, and their Hearts fainted through fear, they could not have taken joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, Fears, and Sorrows Courage and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts attend upon each other, and go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that doth not live above the fear of Poverty for the Goſpel ſake, will moſt diſhonourably flinch, when his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is in danger for it, the loſs of a little, (comparatively to the whole) will gall, and perplex him, and you ſhall ſeldome find him guilty of the ſame Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (as he counts it) twice his fears ſtill make him keep out of harms way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Self-denial, that firſt Leſſon which a Chriſtian is to learn in the School of Chriſt, and which though he be alwayes learning, he's never ſo perfect in as he ſhould be. <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. In Self-denial conſiſts the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part, and power of Godlineſs, and Religion, without which we can no more be ſincere Chriſtians (whatever our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion may be) then we can be Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon; and this is highly requiſite, yea abſolutely neceſſary to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Act, <hi>the taking joyfully the ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Goods.</hi> Moſt Profeſſours cannot

               </p>
               <p n="6">6ly. A low eſteem of theſe worldly goods, eſpecially compared with this Heavenly Subſtance. What a man eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates very highly, it's very ungrateful to him to part with it; he cannot do it with any joy. Mens value of terrene Treaſures, muſt be brought to a very low ebb (and that by an exceeding high appretiation of unſeen immortal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,) before they can take joyfully the ſpoiling the ſame. The reaſon why ſo many Profeſſors ſtick at this, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Earth out-weighs in the ballance of their eſteem, Heaven. Thoſe Saints that have their converſations in Heaven; that are frequently taken up into the Mount of Contemplation, to view and behold their moſt excellent Inheritance there; that often revolve in their minds
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108256:86"/> the cogitations and thoughts of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable pleaſures and delights; the whole world, with all its glories, is no more to them, when compared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, than a drop is to the Ocean, a beam to the whole body of the Sun, or the ſmalleſt punct or point to the vaſt expanded and encompaſſing Heavens: After they have looked upwards a while, and pierced into eternity, and then caſt their eyes upon the things of this lower world (which are admired ſo much by thoſe that never beheld better) they all ſeem to vaniſh and diſappear (as bluſhing, and being aſhamed, from a conſciouſneſs of their vileneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections to ſtand before thoſe very mental Idea's that they have of what they have ſeen in the other world) and become very contemptible to them. Its from want of a ſuperlative eſteem of this better and abiding ſubſtance in Heaven, that men reluctate ſo much to part with for God, and Chriſt, the vacuous and flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſcous things here upon Earth; things that are ſo empty, and therefore cannot fill; things that are ſo tranſitory, and therefore muſt leave an immortal ſoul.</p>
               <p n="7">7ly. The weaning of our affections from worldly good; from eſtates and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108256:87"/> riches; a conſiderable mortification and crucifixion to them, in reſpect of love and deſire for them, and delight in them. What a man intenſly loves, vehemently deſires, and abundantly delights in; that he cannot joyfully part with; for that is a rending of the thing from the ſoul, which puts it to grievous pain. Every mans ſorrow in loſing any earthly good, is proportionable to the love he had for it, and delight he took in it. And when theſe affections are in exceſs, and acted beyond thoſe due bounds and limits, that reaſon ſhould, and which Divine Laws have preſcribed, and ſet unto them; they make their darling objects at laſt the moſt ſmarting Rods to correct and laſh them with for their folly: And ſometimes they become ſharp ſwords, cruelly and deeply to wound them, that had too kindly entertained them before. All that violent, and unbounded ſorrow that we ſee in many, when ſome finite good flies away from them out of ſight, and returns no more; proceeds from the deep poſſeſſion it had in the ſoul by a no leſs imperious and commanding love before. This is ſo univerſally an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented truth, that it clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and proves another, <hi>viz.</hi> That no
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108256:87"/> man will, or can take joyfully the ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his goods, till ſuch affections be moderated towards them; or in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree be withdrawn from them. Could we that profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, but follow, and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Pſalmiſts advice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10. <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not thy heart upon them.</hi> And the Apoſtles, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. to have our converſation without cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, without the love of money, as that Greek word ſignifies; and that counſel of his which we have in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Set your affections upon things that are above.</hi> And were we but as the Apoſtle was in the 6th chap. of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> v. 14. <hi>crucified to the world, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; had the world crucified unto us, then would it be eaſily attainable for us to do what the <hi>Hebrews</hi> did; and the preſent Doctrine ſhould not be judged ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, or ſo little practiſed as it is. Let us but cloſe, and ſhut our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the world, while we have it in our hands, and then we ſhall neither ſigh, nor ſob, to let it go for the Goſpel, and the great concerns and intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt: But if this world be profoundly radicated and riveted in mens hearts, and have the prevailing intereſt in their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108256:88"/> affections, to ſpeak to them, to uſe all the ſwaſion and counſel that we can to make them loſe and leave it thus joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſame, is an attempt as vain as to command Mountains to remove out of their places, and flie up into the Air; or the Sun to forbear ſhining, and the Sea flowing at their ſtated times.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly. And laſtly, An act of deliberate Judgment, not a precipitous and raſh act, for that would cauſe repentance and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our folly afterwards. Mens ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious actions are uſually erroneous, and terminate in ſome angry, or penſive reflection upon their incogitant, haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they find hath diſcommoded them. So that to ſuffer joyfully for Chriſt (that ſuch joy may not be turned into ſorrow after from an apprehended miſtake) muſt ſuppoſe ſome deep cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, and conſideration; a weighing in the judgment what the loſs and gain will be thereby: This therefore reſults from a compariſon made between theſe two, and a ſober pondering judgment paſſed thereupon, which will prevent all after repentance; for the ruminating ſoul finding that the diſproportion is ſo vaſt between what it ſhall loſe, and what it ſhall gain; and that the former is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108256:88"/> to be compared with the latter; it ſhall never befool it ſelf for ſuffering, and learn to be wiſer thereby for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to verifie that old Proverb, <hi>That bought Wit is beſt;</hi> and that ſaying of the Heathen — <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>A fool is wiſe after he hath ſuffered.</hi> When the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Hebrews</hi> what they had ſuffered, and what joy they had therein; he makes it an argument why they ſhould perſevere and be conſtant in ſuffering; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, they had not declared any repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or ſorrow for their former folly. Such praeconſideration there was to part with their goods for the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel. The reaſon of many mens inconſtancy, and inſtability in ſuffering for Chriſt; (but after perhaps they have endured a little, they flinch, is, the want of a thorow deliberate judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they engage in ſuch a ſight. So much thoſe words of our Saviour import in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32.

And yet, though this may, and is ſometimes made good in the plain literal ſenſe (a certain number being put for an uncertain, an hundred-fold for manifold, as the other Evangeliſts explain it) and in <hi>ſpecie;</hi> yet it is not alwaies ſo: And though the former ſenſe, according to the judgment of ſome, may be true in part; yet its not in the whole only, ſo far as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing will ordinarily admit of it; for an hundred Wives, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Mothers, &amp;c. are not to be expected, though a far greater eſtate may, than that which is forſaken for the Name-ſake of Chriſt. Therefore the performance of the promiſe is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>eminenter;</hi> that though God doth not give thoſe things formally, and ſpecifically, yet he will do it eminently. What are relations and poſſeſſions for? but comfort: Now when there is by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108256:90"/> any a dereliction and forſaking of theſe for Chriſt, they ſhall have that in God, and receive ſuch exuberant conſolations from him, which all the creatures would be to him (yea and far more) if they were multiplied an hundred times. Did all that profeſs the Chriſtian Religion firmly believe this; or did they but feel and taſte, before they are called to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for their Religion, thoſe ſweet and pure joyes that are an effluence from God and Heaven; did they not really think their principal (if not all their) comforts to be wrapt, and bound up in their preſent enjoyments, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; (and all becauſe <hi>Senſe</hi> is the great Dictator to them, and their ſouls lye ſo much under the dominion thereof) ſo many of them would not deſert in the day of tryal, their moſt noble Religion, as they do. The enemies of the Saints, when they drag them to priſons, and ſhut them up in dungeons, and ſpoil them of their goods, they conclude they have hereby made them miſerable, and reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves upon them, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor conſidering what an effectual courſe they have taken to make them more happy: How they have taken away puddle waters, that they may

Senſual ſouls, and worldly-minded men, wonder often at the Saints comforts, when they ſeem to be denuded and deveſted of all, not knowing, as our Saviour ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, that they have meat to eat which they know not of, <hi>John</hi> 4.32. The ſweet <hi>effluvium</hi>'s of theſe joyes, and their ſecret illapſes into holy ſouls, cannot by all humane or diabolical malice and power be obſtructed, or intercepted; they have their occult conveyances and communications to the ſouls of ſuffering Saints, elſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had not taken joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Infer.</hi> Secondly, How wiſe a choice they make, that leave and abandon this world for the ſake of Chriſt; ſeeing they do not deprive themſelves of preſent joy and comfort; and likewiſe render themſelves capable of a better, and more excellent ſubſtance by it. It matters not what hypocritical Profeſſors cenſure them for, who think it their greateſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108256:91"/> to ſecure what they have, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of the Goſpel, the pure Chriſtian Religion, and the Intereſt of Chriſt in the world. They may ſecretly deride them for imprudence, raſhneſs, inconſiderateneſs, and perhaps worſe; with the openly profeſt and declared enemies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but when theſe <hi>children of the Kingdom are caſt out into utter darkneſs, Matth.</hi> 8.12. and ſee theſe (now <hi>judged</hi> fools) inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting everlaſting life, and light; then, when its too late, will they be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of, and juſtifie their wiſdom. Its an amazing and confounding thing, to conſider how ſtrong, and unto how high a pitch mens reaſon is raiſed, when it's exerciſed about earthly things, and is to paſs a judgment upon them, and how enervated and enfeebled; and at what a low ebb it is, when it comes to be acted about heavenly things, and is to paſs a true judgment upon them. Its rare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to this, to find a man that's <hi>compos mentis,</hi> that hath his right wits; but moſt men here, are like to ſome mad-men, who will diſcourſe ſoberly and rationally, till that be the ſubject, which was the firſt occaſion and cauſe of their madneſs, and then they quickly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108256:92"/> diſcover their diſtemper: And as ſuch phrenetical perſons think all men ſo but themſelves, and judge the moſt ſage diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to be but folly: Even ſo world-minded Hypocrites, with the large ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Senſualiſts in the world, think the wiſe traffick and trade of a few Saints for Heaven and Eternity, (while they adventure, and ſometimes loſe all their worldly enjoyments for the ſame) to be a moſt unadviſed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, to bewray much debility of reaſon, if not ſome phrenſie, to have ſeized upon them. And though perhaps they will not alwaies; or all of them will not thus explicitly and openly brand them with folly and madneſs, yet they will do it implicitly and tacitly, either by aſcribing what they do, to ſome ſullen obſtinate humour (for they who will ſo gratifie this, hazard and loſe their eſtates, and outward comforts are moſt egregious and enormous fools; do I ſay fools? yea highly inſanous and ſit for Bedlam) or to too much niceneſs and and over-ſcrupleneſs of conſcience, which doth ſufficiently put the fool upon them, while it aſſerts the exility (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothingneſs) of ther reaſon. But true Believers can live above all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108256:92"/> and patiently wait till their wiſdom in another world be avoucht &amp; juſtified by Chriſt; or their viſible and moſt glorious enthronement there do clearly demonſtrate, not only the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but the ſupereminency thereof, and what it's moſt noble origin and diſcent was,<note place="margin">James 3.17.</note> when ſo much unknown unto, diſdained and viliſied by the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Infer.</hi> Thirdly, That Aſſurance of Heaven is attainable here upon Earth; it may be had, though all the children of God have it not; it's no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing to be obtained; for if it were, that counſel and command (which makes it a duty) were vain, which we have, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure:</hi> Which words are not to be underſtood of an objective, but ſubjective certainty, ſure to our ſelves in our own hearts and conſciences. When the <hi>Hebrews</hi> knew in themſelves that they had in Heaven this better and enduring ſubſtance, it implyes (as hath been noted) that they had ſome aſſurance of a right to it, and a poſſeſſion of it. But this was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar (as a priviledge) to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108256:93"/> them; but it's that which Saints now, and to the end of the world may have likewiſe. It muſt indeed be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that aſſurance of our ſalvation is not with facility and eaſe, but with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duouſneſs and difficulty (as uſually the choiceſt and moſt excellent things are) obtained. This bright and precious Jewel cannot be brought into the ſoul, but by the greateſt aſſiduouſneſs, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful laboriouſneſs, higheſt and conſtant ſolicitude and care; as the Apoſtolical Exhortation imports; <hi>Give diligence,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) which ſignifies all manner of ſtudiouſneſs, ſeriouſneſs, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in doing. It requires a cloſe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God; an obſervant watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over our own hearts; a frequent, impartial, ſedulous exploration, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith: Prove your own ſelves:</hi> Which things too many, Chriſtians being too often omiſſive and negligent of, they poſſeſs it not: And whatever aſſurance any man pretends to and boaſts of, that he obtains not in this way, it will prove falſe and deluding, and leave him ſhort of Heaven, and all his hopes of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, under a moſt miſerable
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108256:93"/> abortion and fruſtration. If the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Chriſtians want aſſurance, the fault is their own. The ſloth and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the torpor and ſluggiſhneſs of their ſouls; their oſcitancy and careleſneſs, their inactivity, inſedulity and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the performance of all thoſe holy duties, which are the vital parts of Chriſtian piety, is too frequently the cauſe hereof. The want hereof likewiſe in many, is to be aſcribed to the not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of their reaſon vigorouſly, and enough; for its uſually (if not alwaies) wrought in a rational way: for as the ſoul of man hath the power of ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo hereby Gods Children muſt argue themſelves into this joyful Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is done by inferring one truth from another, and drawing true concluſions from right premiſes; which are two propoſitions that help them to ſyllogize. The firſt of theſe is Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſuch a Propoſition as is infallibly true, becauſe it is founded in the Word of God: As for example; let it be that, <hi>He that believeth on Chriſt, hath everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, Joh.</hi> 3.13.

Much in ſuch a way as this (that requires the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our reaſon) is Aſſurance wrought, which many ſincere Saints not taking, but waiting for, and expecting ſome immediate teſtimony and witneſs from Heaven, are longer clouded with fears and doubts as to their eternal eſtate. Its true, when all this is done, ſuch may want Aſſurance, both becauſe they may not after a diligent ſearch, experience ſuch a Propoſition (there being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite hereunto beſides reaſon, the ſpecial help of the Spirit, which may not alwaies be afforded) and though they may, yet may they haſitate and demurre, and not have the confidence to draw the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which muſt be done likewiſe by the aſſiſtance of the ſame Spirit; which is ſometimes (though for moſt wiſe ends) denyed them. But yet notwithſtanding
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108256:96"/> this conceſſion, its moſt probable (if not an indubitable truth) a comfortable Aſſurance by ſuch means (the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring therewith) is attained unto; though ſtill it muſt be confeſſed, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ſeveral degrees, and durations, and ſo is not equally in all that have it; neither for meaſure, nor for time. I might diſcourſe much more largely of this Doctrine of Aſſurance, but that would not be pertinent here. I only ſpeak ſo much of it as ſhall make a clear way to the enſuing particular.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Infer.</hi> Fourthly, Then that this Aſſurance of an Heavenly Subſtance ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it very facil and eaſie to part with our earthly goods. The ſoul that can once ſay, I know in my ſelf that I have in Heaven a better, and an abiding Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, an immortal Treaſure: Its never put to any hard ſtruglings and conflicts, to forſake all the treaſures in the world, when the glory of God, the intereſt of Chriſt and Religion calls him to do it; but with the greateſt promptitude and readineſs; with the higheſt alacrity and chearfulneſs he parts with all. Let the world court, and complement the ſoul never ſo much; make the largeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to it; uſe all its blandiſhments and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108256:97"/> allurements, with the utmoſt of its craft and skill; and never ſo earneſtly ſolicit the ſame, to hold and keep it faſt, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and ſtick to it; it is inflexible; it will not yield; no conqueſt can be made of it; its hardned againſt them all: It can be no more moved herewith, than a man would be with importunate intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſolicitations to continue in ſome petite and contemptible Cottage, and little ſpot of ground, when ſome magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent <hi>Seraglio;</hi> ſome moſt illuſtrious Palace and mighty Empire were offered to him, and he had a full and infruſtrable aſſurance alwaies to poſſeſs the ſame. If a man were the Abſolute Lord of all the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and had as many Pearls, as there are Pebble-ſtones; could accumulate and heap up the Gold of <hi>O, hir,</hi> as high as the higheſt Mountain, or Pyramides; could he poſſeſs as many millions of the pureſt Gold and Silver, as there are grains of ſand, piles of graſs upon the earth, drops of water in the Ocean, Stars in the Firmament, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the beginning to the end of time; Had he at once as many bright orient Gems and Jewels, with Imperial Crowns, as there are Atoms; as have, or ſhall be hairs upon all mens heads in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108256:97"/> world: Or were he the poſſeſſor of as many Kingdoms; yea worlds, as there are fiſhes in the Sea, fowls of the Air, beaſts, reptiles, and inſects upon earth, yet would his Aſſurance of this one Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Subſtance (though it were but of the loweſt degree, and no pleropherie and full perſwaſion, that doth exclude, and will not admit of the leaſt doubt) it would make him abandon,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> and reject all as dung and droſs for Chriſt; for his Goſpel, and any truth that hath the ſtamp of his Authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: Yea and all this it would do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging, and murmuring; much more without abſorping ſorrow, if not without one penſive thought. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is evident and plain; becauſe there is not ſo great a diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a mite and all theſe numberleſs millions, as is between them and this one Subſtance, this one Inheritance in Heaven. And beſides, this Aſſurance is never wrought in, or obtained by any ſoul before the prevailing bent, and ſtrongeſt byaſs of its will be unto, and its actual choice be made of this immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal treaſure, which conquers the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of parting with what is earthly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Infer.</hi> Fifthly, Then (as connective
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108256:98"/> with the former, and a further amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it) that they who will not chearfully part with, and take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods for the ſake of Chriſt, cannot have any Aſſurance of this better Subſtance, or any real right and title to the ſame. Its true, ſuch men may be (and many of them uſually are) the greateſt pretenders to Aſſurance, and to the moſt confident Hopes of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing Heaven. But alas! all will prove but a vain and vaniſhing dream in the end; and ere long they ſhall awake, and find it to be ſo; if not in this world to retrive the miſtake and errour; yet in another; covered with horrours, and clothed with conſternations; when eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames ſhall thorowly awaken, and effectually convince them of that moſt groſs deluſion they layd under; while they thought their right and title ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the treaſures of eternity, yet to honour and glorifie God, (and ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſupreme and higeſt ends of their lives and beings) and to maintain the Intereſt of their Redeemer in the world; they will not part with thoſe trifling treaſures that are circumſcrib'd, and bounded with a few moments of time, beyond which by the decree and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108256:98"/> determination of the Eternal God, they ſhall not paſs: And when they thus awake, and their eyes are thorowly opened, they ſhall ſee, and know, that the Aſſurance and hope which they had a firm and fixed dependence upon, were but like golden Chains (and ſo more pleaſing) that Satan detained, and held them as his priſoners in, till with himſelf he had brought them down into the moſt tremendous Chains of everlaſting darkneſs. Theſe perſons are like to a poor wretched man that I once ſaw in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> who did ſtronly fancy himſelf, and was fully aſſured that he was a King, and had a real right to a Crown and Kingdom: But alas! (while none could convince him of the contrary) all the while he was in <hi>Bedlam</hi> (a moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Palace for this fanciful Prince to live in, and a very diſconſolate Throne to ſit and reign upon:) And though he would aſſume Imperial Grandeur, and with much ſtate and majeſty deport himſelf; yet he poſſeſſed nothing to maintain it, but in his own imagination. Such a Heaven, ſuch a Crown of life and Glory ſhall theſe one day find (after all their Aſſurance) they are the poſſeſſors of; who would not ſubordinate all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108256:99"/> their earthly intereſts and poſſeſſions to Jeſus Chriſt; and who would rather part with his pure Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than theſe ſhould ſuffer the leaſt impairment and diminution; much leſs would they ſuffer the loſs of all for the ſame. And though theſe men do think they are the only Sophies, the only Oracles for wiſdom in the world, and that the Syſteme of the beſt Politicks, and the Epitomy of all true prudence is in their brains; and apprehending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to move in the higheſt ſphere of reaſon, to be Stars of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for underſtanding; and admiring their own Intellects, as elevated to the higheſt Zeninth, and ſublimated to the moſt lofty pitch: they judge themſelves moſt worthy of the <hi>Chair,</hi> to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and dogmatical Dictators unto all others. Yet it is not long before it will appear both to themſelves, and all others; how much they were void of all true reaſon; what its tenuity and ſlenderneſs was, and how much more mad they were than any of thoſe ſent to <hi>Bedlam</hi> to be made ſober, to recover their loſt wits, to conſolidate their crackt brains, and redintegrate their crazy and ſhattered reaſon: Oh! you
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108256:99"/> that are ſo tenacious of a little guilded earth, and glittering clay (as if it were your God, and Supreme Good) that will ſin againſt your very light, debauch your own conſciences, giving them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a deadly ſtab, and mortal wound (and after by various Narcotick and ſtupefactive potions; or by ſome ſtrong enchantments and charms (which are compoſed of a few fine-ſpun and Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web diſtinctions) making them for a few daies inſenſible, and laying them aſleep;) rather than you will hazard, or ſuffer the loſs of the ſame for the very Religion that you profeſs, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated Chriſtians from; or for that Religion in its moſt pure and undefiled conſtitutions: Conſider, I pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, how inauſpicious and unhappy that tenure is like to prove to your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls; how certainly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly it doth augurate and portend your loſs of God and Heaven for ever; and that the Aſſurance and hope that now you think you have, will prove a heart-breaking cheat, and be one high aggravation of your miſery to eternity. For if you had ſuch an Aſſurance, you would take joyfully (with the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) the ſpoiling of your goods for the ſame
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108256:100"/> pure Worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt. You may as rationally ſuppoſe that the Sun ſhould harden and ſoften the ſame Clay, and the Fire the ſame Wax; or any natural cauſe in an ordinary way of operation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moſt contrary effects in the ſame ſpecifick matter; as that the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a future eternal happineſs, and immortal glory, ſhould make ſome ſo weaned from this world, and mortified to it; and in ſo great a meaſure draw off their hearts and affections from it, that with much facility &amp; joy they can leave and forſake it, when called thereunto; and yet in others, it ſhould ſuffer their ſouls to be ſo faſt glued unto the world, to adhere and ſtick ſo cloſe to the ſame; to be ſo deeply ſunk into the earth, and their riches and treaſures to have that prevailing intereſt in them (as if they were incorporated) that, (though they have the ſame call, and have the ſame Cauſe to ſuffer for, as the propugnation and defence of Goſpel-truth) they will no more leave it, and ſuffer a ſeparation and divorce from it, than they will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their skin to be torn from their fleſh, or their fleſh and ſinews from their bones, when they can prevent it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Infer.</hi> Sixthly That it's not enough
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108256:100"/> to take the ſpoiling of our goods for Chriſt, unleſs it be done with joy. Some mens darling luſt is more pride, than co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; and therefore to keep their credit and reputation among the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Religion, they may run an equal hazard of their eſtates with others in ſerving and worſhiping God; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may actually loſe as much as others; yet it's with much more inward diſquietneſs, and diſcompoſure of mind; the reminiſcence of, and reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their loſſes (eſpecially if conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) is with much ſadneſs and ſorrow: Their preſent parting with their goods puts them to much pain, though they will conceal it, that their honour may not be clouded: But this is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, nor approved of by him, becauſe it ſprings not from any prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love to him, and his Goſpel; or from a predominant intereſt that they have in their affections. The conflict is not between grace and corruption, or between it and temptation; but between two different luſts, and the one muſt yield to the other; which never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates heart-uprightneſs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Infer.</hi> Seventhly, That both the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108256:101"/> taking joyfully the ſpoiling of our goods, or ſuffering for our Religion here depends upon the knowledge and hope of a reward hereafter; and the poſſeſſion of that reward hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends (when called to it) upon taking joyfully the ſpoiling of our goods, or ſuffering for Religion here. This is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe implyed in the Propoſition. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> doing the one upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the other, ſuppoſeth a neceſſary connexion between them; and that they were convinced effectually of this truth. For who would caſt away that which conſtitutes his happineſs in this world, were it not to gain a greater in another? or who would make himſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable here, were it not to avoid eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery hereafter? and had not God by an irrepealable Law, and wiſe San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, made the one the condition of the other. If it were granted that man, as he is Gods creature, and hath his being from him (which his ſubject ſtate, and and Gods abſolute ſoveraignty and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him are a reſultancy from) ſtands obliged, and ought contentedly to act in pure obedience to him, though he ſhould not hereafter enjoy any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable ſtate of bleſſedneſs, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108256:101"/> reward; but after he had done and ſuffered all that's required by his Makers command, he ſhould periſh for ever, or be annihilated, and reduced to nothing: I ſay, if this were granted, how ſoon (what-ever ſome men may talk) would Religion languiſh and expire in the world? what an allay and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would it be to the vigour, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of divine affections in the beſt? how would it damp and ſtifle all readineſs unto, and cheerfulneſs in the loyal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and ſuffering for him. So that if God ſhould ſignifie his will, that we ſhould loſe our goods, and ſuffer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, to maintain his intereſt, and advance his glory in the world, without the promiſe of any future happineſs, and ſo to leave us without any hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation by it. We ſhould ſoon ſee a prevailing averſeneſs and unwillingneſs in all to it: And we ſhould never have read that the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and ſuch a cloud of witneſſes in former Ages, had done it: For we find, that notwithſtanding both the clear revelations, and ſure promiſes of ſuch a bleſſed immortality, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Subſtance in Heaven, with what a paucity and inconſiderable number of men it hath any efficacy, and power
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108256:102"/> to command and govern their lives, and be prevalently influential upon them to do (but) this one thing for the honour of their <hi>Creatour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi> It's true, all our doing and ſuffering cannot merit ſuch a compenſating faelicity; but yet God (dealing with us as we are men, and have a principle of ſelf-preſervation in us) promiſeth this for our great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragnment hereunto. And indeed it ſeems very inconſiſtent, both with the wiſdom and goodneſs of that Eternal Being, that's the Supreme Rector and Governour of the world; and a very unlikely and inefficacious way to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the juſt honour and reputation of his Government over rational creatures, to command the one, without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the other.</p>
                  <p>And yet it would be as incompitable with, and diſagreeing from theſe and other glorious Attributes of God, to confer upon us, and crown us with the latter, without our doing of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: And to aſſert the contrary, is a prodigious ſolaeciſm and abſurdity both in divinity and right reaſon; for it were unwarrantably to maim the Notion of God; to conceive and bear in our minds an Idea of him, altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108256:102"/> to his very Juſtice and Holineſs. Seeing in complyance herewith, he muſt own them as Heirs of the incorruptible Inheritance in Heaven, who have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned and denyed him upon earth; and have preferrd a finite, before his infinite goodneſs and glory. But let the Word of God ſpeak fully in the defence of this truth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>And every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my Names ſake, ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and inherit everlaſting life.</hi> Now, though this be a poſitive aſſertion, yet it includes a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (as in Scripture it's frequent) none but ſuch ſhall inherit this everlaſting life; and this will appear to be the proper genuine ſenſe of it, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>So likewiſe whoſoever he be of you that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> And if no Diſciple of Chriſt, then no Heir of the future glory. All this ſhews us how many (now) of the Viſible Church of Chriſt ſhall be excluded the Kingdom of Heaven, and meet with that moſt dreadful repute, and eternal ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God. <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know not whence ye
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108256:103"/> are. Luke</hi> 13.27. But I having inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt this Diſcourſe with other foregoing particulars, I ſhall not expiate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it further, though it cannot be too induſtriouſly and frequently inculcated upon us, who are ſo backward firmly to believe, and to be brought under the powerful and effectual conviction of ſuch a truth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Infer.</hi> Eightly, How vaſt a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion there is between the Saints pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent loſſes, and their future gain. This is that which makes them ſo joyfully ſuffer the loſs of all things. The inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and unutterable inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them is the ſourſe and ſpring of their joy: They have a ſubſtance for a ſhadow; a ſubſtance that's permanent, and perpetual, for that which is withering and fading. Who will not rejoyce to part with a penny for a pound? with one pound for an hundred? with a hundred for a thouſand? with a thouſand for a million? &amp;c. but yet what's the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the leaſt of theſe, and the greateſt ſumme, to that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an earthly and an heavenly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? But my purpoſe is not to dilate and amplifie this great truth; having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in part gloſt, and paraphraſ'd upon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108256:103"/> it. I ſay but in parts; for who can ſpeak to that fully, which is ſo infinitely above, and beyond the graſp, and reach of his Reaſon; the comprehenſion of his capacity, and the compaſs of his underſtanding? But it is to raiſe the Souls of Saints to a more ſublime, and frequent admiration of the unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Riches of God's free Grace, and exurbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Mercies, and to fill them with more raviſhing contemplations thereof; which this diſproportion doth ſo much illuſtrate and celebrate; varniſh, and beautify with a matchleſs Glory. That there ſhould be an infinite, and eternal reward for a finite, and temporary Act; and that which we are under an indiſpenſable Obligation to do; and when we have done it, to be ſtill unprofitable Servants. That an Act ſhould be thus rewarded by God, that he ſtands in no need of, that he hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon, as Augmentative of, and and additional to his bleſſedneſs; for the uttermoſt contributions of men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, with all other Creatures, can add nothing to him) And that an Act ſhall be ſo ſuperabundanly recompenced, which is but the employing for Gods glory, and the returning to him what is his own, and what we firſt received from him, what he hath but lent us; or we are ſtill but <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108256:104"/> at Will</hi> (his property never being alienated.) That we ſhould have as the Apoſtle ſaith in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Glory for affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; a weight of glory for light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; an exceeding Eternal glory for momentary afflictions. (O! aſtoniſhing <hi>Antitheſis</hi>) In what extatical, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting admirations hereof, ſhould the Souls of Saints be in; and certainly more frequently (than they are) they would be ſo, were they but more with the Apoſtle in <hi>Reckoning that the ſufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory, that ſhall be revealed in him,</hi> Rom. 8.18. And would we but fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and ſteddily meditate hereon; our Souls would not be ſo effaete, and barren of praiſes to God as they are. But we ſhould be ever bleſſing, and adoring him for that ſuperfluous, and reabundant compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the very little that we can do, or ſuffer for him. And ſeeing time is too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for this work, we ſhould more ardently long to Triumph in his Praiſes to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this vaſt diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between our loſſes and our gain, our ſufferings, and our reward, ſhould wonderfully animate, and encourage us to ſuffer the loſs of all things: it ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And certainly were there but an immoration, and dwelling of our moſt ſerious thoughts hereon; we ſhould never dread ſuch ſufferings (which are ever worſe in fearing, then in feeling them) as we do; not be ſo averſe to undergo them as we are.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Infer.</hi> Ninthly, That one and the ſame Heavenly ſubſtance belongs to all Saints and all Sufferers, for their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>There is but one Kingdom,</hi> Matt. 25.34. <hi>one Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. <hi>One Crown,</hi> Rev. 1.10. <hi>one Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21. that belongs to them all.

What thoſe different degrees of Glory are, that ſome aſſert ſhall be in Heaven, proportioned to the attained degrees of Grace upon Earth, (and which ſome places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeem to point at,) is ſomething diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to underſtand, and to give ſatisfactory Anſwers to thoſe Objections which might be raiſed againſt the ſame. The eſſential bleſſedneſs, and glory of the Saints is the ſame, its one <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but ſomething accidental there may be to increaſe, and heighten the joy; as there will be in Hell to increaſe the Sorrows and Miſery of the damned; and to make the damnation of ſome greater than others, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.14. This truth I thought fit to infer, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe that are the Children of God, but whoſe condition is low and mean, and expoſeth them to the ſlights, and contempt of the World.

It likewiſe may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter abundant conſolation to thoſe that have but a very little loſe for to Chriſt, whoſe Eſtates are ſo exigious, and ſmall that its perhaps their grief, and trouble, they have no more to adventure, and part with for him. Let all ſuch know they ſhall be as well rewarded in Heaven, as thoſe who forſake the greateſt Treaſures for him; for its their <hi>All</hi> and ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates their ſincerity, and the ſupremacy of Gods intereſt in their Souls: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>whoſoever ſhall give to drink a Cup of cold Water</hi> (that is when he hath no better Liquor to give) <hi>in his Name to his Diſciples, and becauſe they belong to Chriſt, ſhall not loſe their reward,</hi> Matt. 10.42.

And as when the poor Widdow caſt her two Mites into the Treaſury, it was highly applauded and approved by Chriſt, and as acceptable to him as the <hi>much</hi> which was thrown in by the rich, and no doubt as highly rewarded by him in Heaven, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.41, 42, 43, 44. ſo thoſe that loſe their

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108256:109"/> I think that Chriſtian who will loſe his whole Eſtate (be it more or leſs) for Chriſt, will loſe his life too: But this is certain, that he who will not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and forſake the one, will not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, nor lay down the other.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, From hence infer, that the poſſeſſion of this Heavenly Subſtance will not admit of, nor conſiſt with any grief and ſorrow.

The hope that Princes have of Crowns and Kingdoms, raiſeth their joy above an ordinary pitch: but when the day of actual <hi>Coronation</hi> and Inthroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation comes, then their triumphs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. Thus Gods children rejoyce in hope of a future Crown, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. and their joy ſurmounts the joy of Princes: but when they hear thoſe words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> And when they ſhall be crown'd by their deareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer in the preſence of all the holy

What ſhouting for joy will there then be? All Triumphs, and Exultations at Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Inſtalments here, are but dark reſemblances of what will then be. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſighs, and groans, and tears they ſhall know no more. To uſe thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 51. ver. 11. <hi>The redeemed of the Lord ſhall return, and come with ſinging into heaven</hi> (inſtead of <hi>Zion) and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their head: They ſhall obtain gladneſs, and joy; and ſorrow, and mourning ſhall flee away.</hi> How inconceivably ſweet muſt their ſolace then be?

What though a Dunghill Cock contemn a pearl from the ignorance of its worth, or its unſutableneſs to his vile, degenerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it's a Pearl ſtill, and highly valued by a man. What though a filthy Swine may trample the pureſt Gold with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Feet in the mire; and beſmear it all with Dirt, it's Gold ſtill? whoſe worth is owned, and acknowledge by a man. What though a dull and ſordid Aſs when phalerated, and in trappings; or loaden with Gold, attract the Eyes and admiration of the vulgar, and more ignoble Natures; while a more generous Creature (<hi>as a ſprightly beautiful, and well proportioned Horſe, whoſe Neck is clothed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108256:116"/> with Thunder, the glory of whoſe Noſtrils is terible. Who rejoyceth in his ſtrength, and goeth to meet the armed men. Who mocket at fear and is not affrighten, neither turneth his back from the Sword: Who ſwalloweth up the ground with fierceneſs and rage. And ſaith among the Trumpets Ha, Ha, who ſmelleth the Battel a far off; the Thunder of the Captains, and the ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Job.</hi> 39.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) paſſeth by without any obſervant reſpect, but yet is more highly valued, and more delightfully viewed, by a noble Spirit. Let Aſſes (in another ſenſe) loaden with Gold, and Earthly Treaſures be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men like to themſelves, whoſe ſouls are ſordid, and of a Dunghil conſtitution, yet you ſhall have a venerable reſpect and honour from thoſe that have the true Sentiments thereof; who value men, not as Beaſts, but from an internal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual worth.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe you are contemned of all by reaſon of your poverty, yet is not the glory of God; the Crown of Glory? the Honours of the other World, which ſhall ſhortly be conferred upon you, (to which an immerceſſence, and immortality is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate) be ſufficient for you, have you not the lively hope hereof; do you never
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108256:116"/> rejoyce in the hope of the ſame? are you without the foreveiw, and proſpect of it? while you preach it to others. Do not you ſee a ſuperabundant fulneſs in it to compenſate all the contempt, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you meet with in a world (where your worth is not known) for a few days.</p>
                  <p>Have you not often preacht up a life of Faith, and preſt others to live, have you not by many rational, and ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments urged and perſwaded others, to be couragious, and to live above the fear of ſuffering, and will you not live upon your own Doctrine? will you not be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the practical Part? will you be the firſt that ſhall diſcover unbelief? ſhall there be any cauſe to ſay of you, as Chriſt ſaid by way of a ſmart reprehenſion, and objurgation to his Diſciples, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> or as <hi>Mark</hi> hath it. <hi>why are yee ſo fearful?</hi> How is it that ye have no Faith, (as if weak Faith ſometimes will ſtand the Soul in no more ſteed, then If it were none at all.) how unanſwerable a thing is this before God.</p>
                  <p>It's granted indeed you do not ſtand obliged to preach at all times, nor in all places, as things may be circunmſtantiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if you cannot without manifeſt,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108256:117"/> and apparent ruine, to your ſelves and your Congregations and without conſtant oppoſition in one place, preach publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then you muſt do it more privately, and ſecretly. (which is clear from the Word of God) For hazards you muſt run, and dangers you muſt expoſe your ſelves to in preaching the Goſpel either publickly, or privately. And though God doth allow you the uſe of your own Prudence to guide you in the management of this, aſwel as other Affairs; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware it be not ſometimes carnal Policy, or degenerous Puſillanimity, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds you from a more publick appearing for God, and Jeſus Chriſt in the diſcharge of your duty.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be God, there are many of you; who have with wonderful, and laudable Reſolution, and boldneſs preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel, who I hope will ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, and endure to the end. But as for thoſe that quit their work, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it aſide, either from danger, or becauſe they have found a more plentiful way of living in the World (and probably with greater credit, and reputation) perhaps one day they may find what's here aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a truth: If they think there's no need of their miniſterial labours where
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:108256:117"/> they are; or that they ought to ſilence themſelves, when others would ſilence them. Let them then conſider how they are to <hi>teach all Nations,</hi> Matt. 28.19. and and therefore ſtand obliged by their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to go among thoſe that want the Goſpel (if they may be received) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogate it, and plant Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Such of you, as of late, have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much alarum'd with Popery and do now profeſs great fears of it's invading and overſpreading us, (though while your Proteſtant Brethren were in a ſuffering condition, were trampled under Foot, were trod in the Dirt; and their Wounds were bleeding afreſh (till his Majeſties mercy was in ſome meaſure a Soveraign <hi>Balſome</hi> to heal them) And all the while you were helping forwards their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rejoycing therein; when at the ſame time, not the edge of any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law, and Statute was turned againſt the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> nor they in the leaſt valuerated and wounded therewith: Yea when at the ſame time they were your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Companions, and you had your mutual Caraſſes, none of them were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at your Courts, for their Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, nor were excommunicated, nor were ever plagued and peſtered with writs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108256:118"/> 
                     <hi>De Excorm. Cap.</hi> were not therewith dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from their Wives, and Children, nor hunted like Patridges upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.) I beſeech you if your fears (which God prevent) come to paſs, approve your ſelves to be firm, and well grounded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; and of the true reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by taking joyfully the ſpoiling of your Goods for the pure worſhip, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. Look to it that you leave your Benefices, your Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Dignities, Promotions and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that you zealouſly ſhew your ſelves <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> to the corrupt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated Romiſh Doctrines. Take heed that after you have boaſted your ſelves ſo much (excluſively of all others) to be the true Children, and Legitimate off-Spring of your Mother the Church, you do not at laſt publiſh a contract of Matrimony betwixt Her, and his <hi>Holineſs</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> or at leaſt proſtitute her to his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Stupratious. And beware (leaſt to ſave what you have) you do not (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons well Skilled in Rhetorick,) by ſome <hi>Synareſis</hi> contract two oppoſite Doctrines into one, or by ſome new contrived <hi>Craſis</hi> make a meddle, and mixture of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:108256:118"/>
                  <p>Secondly, To the people that hear them. Conſider the duty is not incumbent upon your Miniſters only thus to ſuffer, but as much upon your ſelves: You are apt enough, many of you, to ſpur them forwards, to adventure their all for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but draw back your ſelves: If they will not make themſelves poor for Chriſt, and expoſe their Wives and Children to beggery, or much penury and miſery; then you are apt to reprove them as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and worldly-minded: Many of you will make plentiful proviſion for your own Families, and leave hundreds and thouſands to your Children; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern not your ſelves how little theirs have, or what becomes of their Poſterity. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, all the Hebrews were not Miniſters, nor the greateſt part (if any of them;) what was therefore their duty, is yours. Let me now to conclude this diſcourſe, ſpeak joyntly to all, and offer a few Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Have you not a <hi>cloud</hi> of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? the Hebrews, Primitive Chriſtians without number, that have done this; have ſuffered the loſs of all things for the ſake of Chriſt? You are not the firſt; you are not called to break the ice, that you ſhould ſhrink and be ſtartled at it. How
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108256:119"/> cogent an Argument doth the Apoſtle make the ſuffering of a multitude before us, why we ſhould ſuffer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. Did God call us to that which never any in the preceeding ages of the Church underwent and ſuffer'd, we might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have a better plea and pretence for our refuſal, but it is not ſo: he calls us to go in a beaten path, and common road; why ſhould we then ſtick at it, or be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to enter, and hold on in it? This is an encouragement to other Enterpriſes and Atchievements, and produceth a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring boldneſs in us many times; and is it not as rational that it ſhould heighten our courage, and prevail with us to do this? What are we better than ſuch multitudes that have gone before us, that we ſhould be exempt from this kind of ſuffering? or why ſhould our Eſtates be prefer'd before Jeſus Chriſt, his Goſpel, and pure Worſhip, more than theirs? or can we think to enter into the fulneſs of everlaſting joy in another way than they have done?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Have you not many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the faithful God to make you willing, and encourage you hereunto. God is ſo abundantly Gracious, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, that he never from an abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108256:119"/> Power and Authority, commands us either to ſerve him, or ſuffer for him, but he annexeth the promiſe of an ample reward. You do but loſe, to gain; you do but make your ſelves poor, to be rich. Though I might produce a large Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Promiſes, yet that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.29. ſhall ſerve for all: Shall this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſes be of no value or account with us? Shall it not ſignifie more than this world? Will we prefer ſome moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanous Dunghill, or ſhining Duſt, and Earth before it? Certainly if we refuſe to do this for our Lord Jeſus, this and other Promiſes cannot be <hi>exceeding great</hi> and precious to us, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And hereby we do declare to the world, that the Word of God is leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by us, than the word of many men (who are of credit and reputation among us;) And that we actually and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally renounce and diſclaim (though we may profeſs, and pretend the contrary) all right unto, and intereſt in this, and all other promiſes, (that the pages of the Holy Bible are be ſpangled with, as the Firmament with Stars.) It's alſo plain &amp; evident hereby that we have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon them; they are not the <hi>Baſis</hi> of our Hope, the food of our Faith, the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108256:120"/> ſupport of our Spirits; but that they are very impertinences, and ſignifie as much as nothing to us: that they are like Wells without water; Breaſts without milk, that never revive and refreſh us; that we derive and fetch no comfort from. The Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. makes it a valid and nervous Argument why we ſhould <hi>hold fast</hi> the profeſſion <hi>of our faith;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is faithful that hath promiſed. To hold faſt then our poſſeſſions, and let go our profeſſion, is a reflecting of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs upon God, or aſcribing an inſufficieny to what he hath promiſed, to make us happy; and an implicit aſſerting that the Apoſtles reaſon, is no reaſon at all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider Chriſt took joyfully the ſpoiling of all for your ſakes: How influential then ſhould this be upon your ſouls to take joyfully the ſpoiling of all that you have for his ſake? He that is Lord of all things, was content to have nothing; to be in a worſe condition than the fowls of the air, and beaſts of the earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.20. <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. Phil.</hi> 2.7. The Text tells us, <hi>he made himſelf of no reputation:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, word for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108256:120"/> word, he evacuated, or emptied himſelf: He not only deveſted himſelf of his robes of Majeſty and Glory, but he brought himſelf, as it were, to nothing; or made himſelf worth nothing: and all this he did for your ſakes. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That though Christ was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi> (A moſt clear demonſtration of the exuberancy of his Grace, as in the Text it is ſhewed.) And Chriſt did all this as a moſt free under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, when we could lay no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him, (but the contrary, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemies to him) But he having done this voluntarily and freely, it brings you under a neceſſary and indiſpenſible obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, (even by the very law of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) to make your ſelves poor for him, that he through your poverty may be rich; though not in the ſame ſence, that you might be rich by his; But that his Intereſt thereby might be advanced, and the light of his Goſpel more diffuſed; and by all, much glory be brought unto his Name. And oh! how unthankful are they to their <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and how little are they affected with all that he hath done, and ſuffered for them; that will not part chearfully with all earthly treaſures,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108256:121"/> and ſubmit to the loweſt, and moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious condition in this world for him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider how ſoon God can take away an Eſtate, and Riches from you; or you from an Eſtate, and Riches. Do you not ſee the former frequently? many who thought their Mountain of Wealth ſtood firm, and faſt, have it quickly removed, and overturned, and it flies away like a Feather, or like the light Chaff, and the ſmall Duſt before the ſtormy Winds, and the Whirlwinds, how often doth God give Riches a Commiſſion to leave ſuch a man, and ſuch a Family (perhaps, ſometimes becauſe he who is the great Heart-Sercher, knows will never honour him therewith, by ſuffering the loſs of them) and when he doth it, who can put a ſtop to them; how quickly, and and irreſiſtably are they gone? as the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>They make themſelves Wings; they fly away as an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle towards Heaven.</hi> Fire, and Water, and Winds, and ſometimes the Earth it ſelf, devours and ſwallows them up. And ſo God after makes the very Womb wherein they were firſt conceived, and which travelled with them till it had brought them forth, to be the Grave that they ſhall be buried in; and where they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108256:121"/> firſt (as it were) receiv'd their life, there they ſhall receive their death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And God by a courſe of ſuch common Providence doth many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and take back from men more, than perhaps they would be neceſſitated to loſe for Chriſt, had they but hearts to do it. How are we exhorted, and caution'd, not to truſt in riches, becauſe they are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. But its plain our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is upon them (as durable and permanent things,) when we will not part with them for the Goſpel ſake: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they do continue with us, and ſtick cloſe to us, and prove faſt friends indeed, affording all the ſupport and comfort to us they can, cloathing and feeding us moſt ſumptuouſly and deliciouſly, while we act our part upon this terreſtrial ſtage; yet but a very few moments of time, and puffs of breath more muſt paſs away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we take a ſolemn leave of, and bid an everlaſting farewell and adiew to them: Let them clapſe about us, and let us cling never ſo faſt about them, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible death will rend, and tear us each from other. Perhaps many may think within themſelves, and ſay to their <hi>own ſouls,</hi> as we have it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. <hi>Souls you have much goods laid up for many years,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108256:122"/> tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> your caſe, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi> But ye <hi>fools,</hi> do you know how ſoon you ſhal efflate and breathe out your ſouls, give up the Ghoſt, and your murmurring breath; and when your ſouls are required by God of you, then as it follows in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Whoſe ſhall all theſe things be which you have provided? And not only ſo, but what relief will they aford to your trembling and amazed ſouls, and to your guilty, enraged Conſciences before the Bar of Chriſt, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re you muſt certainly ſtand to be judged for holding faſt, and keeping cloſe your goods when you ſhould have parted with them for his ſake. And as it followeth in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. ſo is <hi>he</hi> that layeth up treaſures for himſelf, and is not rich towards God; (and he that makes himſelf moſt poor for him, is moſt rich towards him.) Oh! how much more comfortable will the reflection be in another world, upon all that we ſuffer the loſs of for Chriſt, than upon that which we detain from him, and deny him when he calls for it, and requires it at our hands.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider though you may keep your wordly goods when you ſhould part with them for Chriſt; and though you may make your ſelves rich, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108256:122"/> when others make themſelves poor, yet all ſhall be a curſe, and not a bleſſing to you. Whatever we withhold from God that he calls for, it will prove at laſt like <hi>Achans</hi> wedg of Gold, an accurſed thing to us. As God ſuffers many men to wallow in wealth, and increaſe in riches, according to the vaſtneſs and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of their deſires, and moſt inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appetite after the ſame, not for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but a curſe to them (though they apprehend it not, but the contrary, <hi>i. e.</hi> that their proſpering after this manner is rather an evidence of God's favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them:) So when we deny God our Eſtates, to advance his Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the world; then doth he, as we have it in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>curſe</hi> ſuch bleſſings, though for preſent we feel, and perceive it not. Sometimes indeed the curſe is outward and viſible, when God blaſts mens Eſtates, and cauſeth them to wither and moulder away before their eyes; or after they are dead to melt away like ſnow, when their poſterity doth poſſeſs them. Yet if this never come to paſs, it proves inward and inviſible (which is far more dreadful) a curſe upon their ſouls; ſo that they never thrive, nor proſper af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108256:123"/> God's gratifying the deſires of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they luſted after fleſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15. that he gave them their requeſt, but ſent leanneſs into their ſoul; the ſame may I ſay concerning theſe men for their reſolute and ſtrong tenaciouſneſs of this world, when they ſhould adventure and part with it for Chriſt; he lets them alone to enjoy it, and perhaps abundantly to coacervate, and add to it; but he at the ſame time ſends leanneſs into their ſouls; they ſtarve and famiſh, and pine away; while they ſatten, and fill their Purſes: And as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, Chap. 10. ver. 16. (though not in the ſame ſence,) <hi>God</hi> ſends <hi>among theſe</hi> fat ones <hi>leanneſs.</hi> As the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25. (to which I only allude) <hi>The liberal ſoul</hi> (towards God) <hi>ſhall be made fat;</hi> but for others, <hi>he withholds the dews of heaven from them, and they are not water'd from thoſe upper Living ſprings.</hi> So that an incurable atrophy is now the diſeaſe and diſtemper of their ſpirits: And in this reſpect they have cauſe to ſay as the Prophet ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Our leanneſs, our leanneſs, wo unto us!</hi> And ſo they would; but that like men that are conſumptive, by reaſon of a <hi>Cachexy,</hi> and an evil diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108256:123"/> of body, they gradually waſte, and languiſh, and are very inſenſible of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feel no pain. We can never wiſh them as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> did <hi>Gaius</hi> in his third Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. That above all things they may proſper, and be in health, even as their ſouls proſper. This is the ſin that provokes God to curſe them, as our Saviour did the fruitleſs Fig-tree; Saying unto them, <hi>Let no fruit grow on you hence forward, and for ever.</hi> And when this is done, preſently they wither away, as there the Text hath it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.19. Many profeſſors of Religion may date their ſpiritual lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhments and decays, from the time of their refuſing to ſuffer in this, or other ways for the pure Doctrine of Chriſt. A refuſal to part with theſe periſhing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon this account, proceeds always from an high degree of avarice, and exceſs of covetouſneſs, which is the ruſt and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Religion; and having now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ſo great a dominion over the ſoul, it keeps it bound, and chain'd down to this Earth, and impriſon'd within the narrow confines of this lower world, where it can never thrive or flouriſh, it being none of its proper Element to abide and converſo in: for now its at ſo remote a diſtance
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108256:124"/> from the fountain of living waters, and the pure ſalubrious freſh gales of heaven, (which are moſt proper for it, and which it cannot live and proſper without) that a great lanquor muſt ſeize upon it, and Religion can no longer grow and ſpring up in it. This is one of the thorns that ſuffocate and chaoks this ſpiritual ſeed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, and laſtly: Conſider, if you refuſe to ſuffer the loſs of your Eſtates for Chriſt, he will never own you for his Diſciples: This is the very condition made by himſelf of true Diſcipleſhip, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>So likewiſe, whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple.</hi> He may be <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> but he cannot be really ſo: And its as much as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, Let never ſuch an one expect to be ſaved by me, or have any benefit by my bloud; I will reject and diſcard him for ever. Would you have your Redeemer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs you before his Father, and not be aſhamed of you, when he cometh in his Glory, accompanied with the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. Would you have him then, in the peſence and hearing of God, Angels, and men, (to your exceeding great joy, and everlaſting conſolation)
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108256:124"/> ſay, Father lo, here are my faſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends, that loved me more then the world, that gave up their whole hearts, and all their affections to me, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred me before all their outward and Earthly comforts, that were willing to deveſt themſelves of all, to become poor; chearfully to ſubmit to the loweſt and moſt deſpicable condition for my ſake. Therefore now let them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with all thy Glory, with this incorruptible inheritance, with theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Treaſures; or would have him ſay to your everlaſting confuſion.) Theſe are the worldlings, and Earthly minded Wretches; who eſteemed a little moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Clay and Dirt, before me and my Goſpel, they were for gratifying their ſenſitive Appetites, than for honouring me. I now am aſhamed of them, they had the <hi>Name,</hi> but not the nature of my Deſciples. Let them now eternally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and be for ever baniſhed thy preſence and ſeparated from thy Glory.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, and Laſtly, If you will not part with your Eſtates for Chriſt, you will never part with your Lives, or reſiſt unto Blood for him; if you will not do the leſſer, you will never do the greater. Nature doth moſt regret, and reluctate at
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108256:125"/> this, it abhors diſſolution, and ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict is more ſharp, and the tryal far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when you are called to lay down your Lives for truth. Its a ſad <hi>Omen</hi> that you will betray the Cauſe of Chriſt, when he calls you to be faithful to the death. I do not much doubt that mans dying for Chriſt that can be joyfully poor for him; but he that will not, how can we hope he will endure the torturing Racks, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Flames, and ſuch cruelties as we read the Martyrs in former and latter times have done. Though death is worſe in the fears of it, then in the real ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and moſt Men that dye a natural death, feel as much (if not more) pain than they that dye a violent one for Chriſt, yet becauſe the other is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and irreſiſtable (there being no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg in that War) and this being volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and choſen, moſt men cannot bring their Wills to it. And they whoſe Wills are not effectually bowed, and inclined to the former, there is little ground to hope. they will be to the latter. Let the Cauſe be never ſo good, or the ground of their ſufferings never ſo clear. (He that will not endure a few drops or a ſhower of Rain, it's very unlikely he will endure a bluſtering Tempeſt, and boiſterous Storm.)
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108256:125"/> Thoſe that will be Chriſtians indeed (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paced) ſhould inure themſelves to hardſhips, like good Souldiers as they have opportunities; and are called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they ſhould proceed from a lower to an higer degree, from a leſs to a more grievous kind of ſuffering, till they can ſuffer to the utmoſt extremity for Chriſt. But I ſhall ſay no more by way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade hereunto. I ſhall now anſwer an Objection or two.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Objection is this, I have much to loſe, were it but a little I could part with it for Chriſt. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Who gave thee, or rather lent thee all that thou haſt? who is the high Lord of all thy great Poſſeſſions?

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108256:126"/> ſupream end, and ſo thou art guilty of damning Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the Text; they are Goods indefinitely, ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. and ſo the quantity, and meaſure, or kind doth not after, nor vary the Caſe, be it more, or leſs Chriſt requires of the; to make an offering of it to him, to maintain his Cauſe, and advance his intereſt in the World. This will be no Plea at the Bar of Chriſt, when thou art judged for this refuſal to tell him thy Eſtate was larger then another mans. Let it be never ſo voluminous and vaſt, is it of more worth than Chriſt? and his Goſpel? VVhat vain things do men make their refuge for a while in this VVorld.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that hath but a little, its his all, and as much to him, as all thy Revenues are, ſo that in this reſpect God calls him to ſuffer the loſs of as much, as he doth thee. This I might enlarge but I haſten to conclude, and wind up this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If thou haſt ſo much thou haſt the more then to glorifie God with, and in this ſhouldeſt thou rejoyce; as he that hath the higheſt meaſures of Reaſon, and Learning, and all intellectual, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Abiliments, hath more than others to honour God with. And, he ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108256:126"/> that all theſe ſhould be imployed and improved for this ſupream end; ſo he that enjoys moſt of worldly Treaſures, is in the beſt capacity to do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in Prov. 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Subſtance,</hi> and God is never ſo highly honoured with that, as when the loſs of it is ſuffered for his ſake, as might be largely, and ſtrongly evinced.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This proves the more rotten at the Heart, whatever fair Paint is upon thy Face, and one day after all thy moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Profeſſion of Religion, thou wilt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no more Religious than that young man ſpoken of, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.22. For it's not God (the ſupream good God) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour good that hath the predominant intereſt in thy Heart, which is damnable Hypocriſie. And when thy Heart is eviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, and unboweld, when thy Soul is exenterated, and all its ſecrets expos'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen veiw, and thy paint falls of before the Fire of God's wrath, and the hand of revengful juſtice plucks of thy mask, and Vizard than ſhall it appear to be ſo before Angels, and men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Object. The ſecond is, I have a Family (VVife and Children) to provide for? <hi>An.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This reſults from infidelity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108256:127"/> that thou canſt not truſt God with thy Family, in the diſcharge of thy duty. That thou haſt Faith to believe no further than thy ſenſe can reach, or thou canſt ſee with thy Eyes. Hath God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to do this, and will he forſake thy Wife and Children, when thou art obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his command. But what ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory anſwer can be given to men that are under the power of unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider what an effectual courſe thou takeſt to provoke God againſt thy Family; how juſtly may that which thou detaineſt, and withholdeſt from God be a conſuming Moth in all the reſt, that thou hoordeſt, and heapeſt up for the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If thou doſt loſe, or impair thy eſtate for God he will take a more ſignal, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent care of thy Family, when thou art dead and laid in thy Bed of Duſt, there's no doubt but the faithful God, will make good his promiſes to thy Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a multitude of inſtances, might be produced to confirm this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be more deeply concern'd to get thy Children into Covenant with God; if this once be, he ſtands obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them, only be thou (as thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be) contented that he provide for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:108256:127"/> them, as he according to his infinite wiſdom, think fit. If they be not in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, but diſobedient to his Laws, and Rebels againſt his Majeſty; they deſerve no Proviſion (much leſs that which is plentiful, to be Fuel for their Luſts) in this World.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Its better however thy Family ſuffer, and be in want for a few days here, than that thy ſoul ſhould eternally periſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: It's thy great wiſdom to hazard the former, rather than the latter: It will be little comfort to thy ſoul, when it's in unquenchable flames, and feels the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the never-dying worm; to reflect upon a large Eſtate, and treaſure left to thy Wife, and Children! Having ſaid all this, let me now deſire you to keep out of your hearts, what you have in your hands; with the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Know both how to be abaſed, and how to abound: every where, and in all things to be inſtructed both to be full and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, both to abound and to ſuffer need. Get your affections fixt upon things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, Col.</hi> 3.2. Eye and view more this better and enduring ſubſtance frequently, revolve it in your thoughts, and forſake all things diſpoſitively, and then it will be eaſie to do it declaritively, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108256:128"/> Then let perſecuting and ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Popery come, or whoever you ſhall be perſecuted by for your Religion; to ſecure your Eſtates, you will not forſake the aſſembling of your ſelves together (as the manner of ſome is) <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. purely to worſhip your God; if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it publickly, you will privately; that ſo you may poſſeſs this bleſſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
